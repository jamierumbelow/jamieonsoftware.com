<p>
  From now on, and until further notice, consider me an amateur. At everything.
</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<p>When I was younger, I had some promise.</p>
<p>
  I was fairly bright. I had some early successes. I wrote blog posts that
  people read, and libraries that people used. I spoke at conferences across the
  globe. I was achieving things and going places. I had ambitions to build a
  great company and do important work.
</p>
<p>
  Then I started drinking, and learning how to talk to girls, and I wanted to be
  clever, and I wanted people to think I was clever. And it crippled me. I found
  myself stalling. My head reset around its worse impulses. I was ruled by my
  neuroses. And, worst of all, I never admitted to myself that this had
  happened.
</p>
<p>
  It was easy to frame it positively: I was reprioritising from my career, to a
  richer life. That’s a good thing. I developed hobbies and interests. I met a
  wonderful woman, who now carries my surname.
</p>
<p>
  And all that is true. It’s a wonderful thing. I am so extraordinarily
  grateful.
</p>
<p>
  But I was treading water nonetheless. And missed the biggest bull run of my
  industry, and all those opportunities, in the process.
</p>
<p>
  That would be bad, but forgivable. I was a child, a very young adult. I wasn’t
  happy. I wasn’t a good man. I’m better now.
</p>
<p>
  But I have begun to realise that the problem was deeper: I thought I had
  learned what I needed to. I considered myself grown up already, personally,
  intellectually. From the earliest days, I was arrogant.
</p>
<p>
  Sure, I could still learn new <em>content</em>, but the mode was fixed. I
  thought I was a professional, that I could build and lead, when, in reality, I
  was still an amateur. Any of my few career successes have been built on blags
  and luck.
</p>
<p>
  But I am getting bored of that. I am now
  <a href="https://buildwithtract.com">beginning a company</a> that I think
  could be important, and push forward the UK and the world. It may not work.
  The base rates alone tell me it won’t. But I’m going to try. And in order to
  succeed, I’ll need more than blags and luck.
</p>
<p>I’ll need skill. Right now, I have very little.</p>
<p>So, today, that changes.</p>
<p>
  <strong>From henceforth, I am an amateur.</strong> An amateur software
  engineer. An amateur writer. An amateur thinker. An amateur man. I am parking
  any preconceptions that I might have about knowing whatever the fuck I am
  doing, and striving to figure it out.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I am going to be less confident in my abilities.</strong> I am not
  going to rely on time and tenure as a proxy for expertise. I am going to hold
  my strong opinions more weakly.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I am going to be more open to feedback.</strong> I am not going to
  chase the approval of others, and allow that pernicious form of self-hatred
  affect everything downstream. I am going to learn from them instead.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I am going to study more</strong>, and take my consumption seriously.
  I am going to take more notes and produce more first drafts.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I am going to be more interested in the quality of my work</strong>
  for its own sake, because quality matters. I am going to revise my first
  drafts and produce second drafts, and third drafts, until the marginal
  improvements decrease significantly.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I am going to be more prolific</strong>, because improvement needs
  repetition, and progress demands effort.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >I am going to evaluate what I am doing with respect to a broader set of
    goals and missions.</strong
  >
  I am going to be more purposeful, and more critical.
</p>
<p>I am an amateur. <strong>I am not exceptional.</strong></p>
<p>And I have a lot of work to do before that changes.</p>
