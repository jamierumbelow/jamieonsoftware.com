December passed by in a blur, with our wedding, my birthday, a lot of travel, and more champagne than I care to mention. I had plenty of time to read and relax, and have found myself in January with a newfound sense of focus and purpose. I am a part of something bigger now. The boundaries of my responsibilities extend beyond myself. I now owe myself, my ambitions, my successes, fully to another person. A conspiracy of two.

[Project Hail Mary](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Project-Hail-Mary-Andy-Weir/dp/0593135202) was fun, although I think it tried to be too smart – the science was a little too complicated in a way that felt unbelievable – which made it a poorer book than the Martian. [The Man Who Solved The Market](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X) was just interesting enough to get me through a four-hour flight.

[A very short guide to planning reform](https://www.centreforcities.org/publication/a-very-short-guide-to-planning-reform/), a useful resource to lean on when YIMBY-proselytising. Addresses a lot of the common misconceptions. And [gentrification without displacement](https://stephenhoskins.notion.site/Pennington-K-2021-Does-Building-New-Housing-Cause-Displacement-The-Supply-and-Demand-Effects--505dfd143406488d956eaa59e2435dbb).

Jatan curates some [photos of the Moon](https://blog.jatan.space/p/lunasights). The [Apollo Remastered book is astounding](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apollo-Remastered-Andy-Saunders/dp/024150869X). And Andrew McCarthy gives us the [following gift](https://twitter.com/AJamesMcCarthy/status/1600749501664612353):

ChatGPT can [invent a fairly consistent, heavily inflected language](https://maximumeffort.substack.com/p/i-taught-chatgpt-to-invent-a-language). A fun example use, but I'll be more impressed when it develops some irregular verbs from some sort of environmental or phonetic pressure.

[Guesstimate](https://www.getguesstimate.com) is a really good little tool for generating Fermi estimates.

Science has been doing an experiment on itself for the past 60 years. That experiment is called 'peer review', and [it failed](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-peer-review).

Rohit performs [a Fermi estimate for scary AI](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/agi-strange-equation).

Gastro Obscura [on pot-au-feu](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/perpetual-broth).

Gavin Leech's [papers of the year list](https://twitter.com/g_leech_/status/1607313892644122626).

[2022's Twitter trends](https://twitter.com/LlamaInaTux/status/1607392231119360007). A brilliant reminder of how ephemeral most of the discourse is.

Lowell [projects his own eyeball onto Mars and Venus](https://twitter.com/lucafrighetti/status/1607758734306193409).

Simon Sarris [develops a diet I can relate to](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/how-to-cook-for-odysseus).

Nabeel argues for [reading slowly and deeply](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1608874209375313920).
