Finished the first draft of my book, [Building With Ethereum: Products, Protocols, and Platforms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Ethereum-Products-Protocols-Platforms/dp/1484290445), which is now available to pre-order from Amazon. Some minor edits to do and then to production. Other than that, I've been enjoying drinking again – more on that soon – and reading, relaxing, resting. I'm taking the rest of the year off to plan and scheme.

Heavy fiction month. The Rest is History [prompted me](https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-history-podcast/185-agatha-christie) to start reading some Agatha Cristie, so I sat down over the weekend and read [And Then There Were None](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Then-There-Were-None-Favourite/dp/0008123209), [The Murder of Roger Ackroyd](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murder-Roger-Ackroyd-Poirot/dp/0007527527), and [Sleeping Murder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleeping-Murder-Marple-Agatha-Christie/dp/000819663X). The writing is charming and lovely, and funny, even when grim. You truly get the sense that she's building these tropes as she goes along, that the structure of the whodunnit genre was falling out of her pen as she went. Totally gripping. I've not enjoyed fiction this effortlessly since Station Eleven.

I also read [Red Mars](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Mars-Kim-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0007310161) by Kim Stanley Robinson, a good novel but about 200 pages longer than it needed to be. I find the same problem with most scifi and fantasy. Something about world-building lends itself to self-indulgence? I don't know.

Reread David Yaffe's [Reckless Daughter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Reckless-Daughter-Portrait-Joni-Mitchell/dp/0374538069) in preperation for my Joni Mitchell Interintellect salon, which went well. I put that book down liking her much less as a person and much more as an artist.

An interesting approach to price iteration and programmable pricing structures: [theory](https://priceops.org) and [practice](https://www.tier.run).

Some good housing stuff this month too. Much more energy toward this issue in my little corner of the internet. [Auckland upzoning reforms working well](https://twitter.com/MrSteveDriscoll/status/1587249795428589568), causing [a meaningful decrease in real rents and an increase in affordability](https://onefinaleffort.com/auckland).

[Good interview with Habiba Islam on the Left and Effective Altruism.](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6NnnPvzCzxWpWzAb8/podcast-the-left-and-effective-altruism-with-habiba-islam) I'd like to see something similar for the Scrutonian right.

The excellent Nabeel wanted to learn more about SARS-CoV-2, so [he decoded the genome](https://github.com/nqureshi/sars-cov-2/blob/master/SARS-Cov-2.ipynb). And Nabeel with [some productivity advice](https://nabeelqu.co/advice).

[Some more decent productivity advice,](http://bookofhook.blogspot.com/2013/03/smart-guy-productivity-pitfalls.html) most of which cashes out to 'JFDI'. _"I'll finish it up tomorrow"_, I mutter to myself, as I gaze at the sticky, bulbous pile of washing up.

Tom Forth [raises an excellent question](https://twitter.com/thomasforth/status/1595000478311612417): why do we in the UK chose, so often, in so many ways, to be less productive? (One answer is, [of course](https://samdumitriu.substack.com/p/why-britain-struggles-to-build-infrastructure), NIMBYism, but the question is deeper and the answer more cultural than that.)
