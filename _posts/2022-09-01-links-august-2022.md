Richard Rhodes's [The Making of the Atomic Bomb](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes/dp/1471111237/) was the highlight this month, a detailed and incredibly scientifically literate story of the agglomeration effects of genius and the construction of the atomic age. A long and detailed book but interesting ideas and stories on every page.

Continually impressed by [Stripe Press](https://press.stripe.com) and thoroughly enjoyed [Where Is My Flying Car?](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Where-Flying-Car-Storrs-Hall/dp/1953953182) by J. Storrs Hall. We need more techno-optimistic books. Hope and ambition are technologies too, and should be developed and promoted.

Also finished [The Anarchy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anarchy-Rise-Fall-India-Company/dp/1408864371) by William Dalrymple. Had the chance to chat to Dalrymple last month and his enthusiasm and perspicuity for this subject is astounding. The EIC was a violent and predictable and transformative institution, but it was at the same time path-dependent and its success subject to utterly unpredictable chance. Every time I read history I'm taken aback by the fragility of the world we've inherited.

Noah Smith on [CHIPS and chips](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/industrial-policy-starts-with-semiconductors), and [four reasons why GDP is a useful number](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/four-reasons-why-gdp-is-a-useful).

Regress Studies on [how to choose books](https://regressstudies.substack.com/p/is-it-okay-to-finish-books) and why you should allow yourself to be dragged into books you suspect you won't finish.

[The best of Scott Aaronson](https://www.gleech.org/aaronson).

From [Knowledge spillovers in Silicon Valley](https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f166369.pdf):

> Our IV approach estimates substantial returns to face-to-face meetings with overidentification tests suggesting we are capturing the returns to serendipity that play a central role in the urban theories of Jane Jacobs.

Some good Visa threads on a cluster of related ideas: [do what you want to do](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1436393464468369408), [do it a lot](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1199907654602125312), and [tell others to do what they want to do](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1455243916773494784). I had a great chat with Visa at Future Forum, and his temper and mode and writing is lovely in a happy-go-lucky, auto-optimistic kind of way. [His blog](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/) is also excellent.
