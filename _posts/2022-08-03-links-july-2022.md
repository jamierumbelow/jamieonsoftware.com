ETHCC Paris, The Idler Festival, dinners at the Liberal Club, work on the book, actual work, and learning to fly; it's been a busy month in which I deadlifted 100kg for the first time, only read a couple of books, submitted the first few chapters of **Products, Protocols, and Platforms**, and have found myself exhausted. I am more energised when I am productive, and more productive when I am energised, so ascertaining how to bootstrap myself into either productivity or energy is I think a high-leverage activity with which I'll be experimenting for the rest of the year.

Perhaps the most important thing I read this month was [Eichmann in Jerusalem](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eichmann-Jerusalem-Report-Banality-Evil/dp/024155229X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=). I didn't quite realise how much of a journalist Arendt was, and look forward to reading more of her political theory in the future. It's rare, nowadays, to go from in-the-trenches journalism to academic theorising. (Counterexamples: Gramsci, sort of? Maybe Robert Caro? Anne Applebaum, perhaps?)

Also supplemented Arendt with Richard Evans's [Third Reich in Power](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Third-Reich-Power-1933-Hearts/dp/0141009764), the second volume in the series. I read the first volume maybe a decade ago and enjoyed it. The second was more of a slog.

Just finished [Hard Drive](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hard-Drive-Making-Microsoft-Empire/dp/0887306292/ref=sr_1_1?crid=D7B2ZBP7Q351&keywords=hard+drive+bill+gates&qid=1659523562&s=books&sprefix=hard+drive+bi%2Cstripbooks%2C798&sr=1-1), a book about Bill Gates and the early days of Microsoft. Gates was a _lot_ more competitive and ruthless than I thought – and I thought he was pretty competitive and ruthless!

Also read [All Out War](https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154) by Tim Shipman. Fantastic political journalism, no agenda, just the steady beat and the sporadic bursts of a battle unfolding.

[Political science is horribly underpowered.](https://twitter.com/ryancbriggs/status/1544321988101128195?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) I am in a cynical mood right now, so don't expect these findings to change much.

[A logarithmic map of the entire universe](https://twitter.com/johncoogan/status/1546921877586604032).

A good post from Tanner [on the decline of history majors](https://scholars-stage.org/the-fall-of-history-as-a-major-and-as-a-part-of-the-humanities/) and the relationship between the sciences and the humanities. Also a very well-written letter [on decolonising the curriculum](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/criq.12675) and the contradictions inherent in it.

There's something very distinctive about the 'long-form interviews with macho men for a predominantly working-to-lower-middle-class white male audience that leans right' format, and I can't quite put my finger on what it is. It's far from anti-intellectualism: the hosts and their guests are smart and eager to grapple with complicated ideas. It's not quite one-sidedness, because they can surprised you. It's almost an aesthetic property, a flavour of self-assuredness, the eschewing of the effete. Whatever it is, [this interview with Erik Prince](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwK_XLFOm_I) was swimming in it.

Wonderful lecture [on the F-22 Raptor and the engineering decisions behind it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n068fel-W9I).

[Justin E. H. Smith reviews his two years on Substack.](https://justinehsmith.substack.com/p/two-years-on-substack)

Brie Wolfson wrote [on the work culture early-days Stripe](https://every.to/p/what-i-miss-about-working-at-stripe). A reminder that hard work is a feature, not a bug – and the symptom of a thriving culture, not the cause of it.

Ordinary citizens have [essentially no influence over government in the United States](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2016/01/american-and-chinese-oligarchies.html). What the elites want, they generally get. It's amazing that US society is generally so stable.

[End degrowtherism now](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/how-we-will-fight-climate-change?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email).

There are some [good old episodes on the PricedOut podcast](https://www.pricedout.org.uk/resources/podcast/), covering planning reform, the commercial incentives of house building, etc.
