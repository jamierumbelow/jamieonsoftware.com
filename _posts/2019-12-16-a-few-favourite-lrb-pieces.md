The London Review of Books has been a good companion to me, its prose crisp and clean and sometimes lyrical, its horizons broad. And while it's often a little _too_ political, too much on its sleeve – which hinders the analytical power of some of the more polemical pieces – I was a happy subscriber for years and recommend it to anybody.

For the next month, [the website's paywall will be down](https://lrb.co.uk) and everything will be free. I figured I'd use this opportunity to link to a few pieces that I've read, enjoyed, not forgotten, or otherwise found interesting.

You could start with [Hitchens on Ignatieff on Berlin](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v20/n23/christopher-hitchens/moderation-or-death), Meany on [Schlesinger Jr.](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n03/thomas-meaney/the-hagiography-factory), or [Williams on Parfitt](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v06/n10/bernard-williams/personal-identity). Two pieces by the philosopher Amia Srinivasan, one [on octopodes and consciousness](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n17/amia-srinivasan/the-sucker-the-sucker), the other [on politics and sexual desire](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n06/amia-srinivasan/does-anyone-have-the-right-to-sex) are insightful and elegant. Jeremy Waldron, as ever, writes extraordinarily well [on the shape and character of a politics given by a country's constitution](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n17/jeremy-waldron/quibbling-wrangling), and the tradeoffs (tradesoff?) involved.

David Runciman is a regular contributor, and always interesting: [on David Cameron and the 2016 referendum](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n19/david-runciman/his-fucking-referendum); [on Theresa May](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n12/david-runciman/steely-women-in-a-world-of-wobbly-men); [on Trump](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n19/david-runciman/i-didn-t-do-anything-wrong-in-the-first-place); [on Obama](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n15/david-runciman/the-impermanence-of-importance); [on Gordon Brown](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n01/david-runciman/what-was-it-that-drove-him); and [on artificial intelligence](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n02/david-runciman/diary). Jonathan Rée wrote [on James Harris's Hume](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n24/jonathan-ree/in-such-a-labyrinth), and [on Edwin Curley's Spinoza](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n06/jonathan-ree/horrible-heresies). I've enjoyed articles [on punishment and race in America](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n09/adam-shatz/out-of-sight-out-of-mind), [on Entick v. Carrington](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v38/n15/stephen-sedley/resistance-to-torpor), and Geoffrey Hawthorn's [reflections on my favourite philosopher, Bernard Williams](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n13/geoffrey-hawthorn/what-philosophers-dream-of).

There are [three](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n01/neve-gordon/the-new-anti-semitism) [interesting](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n09/stephen-sedley/defining-anti-semitism) [pieces](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v25/n16/judith-butler/no-it-s-not-anti-semitic) on antisemitism, zionism, Israel, its government, and the relations between all of the above; though none, in my opinion, quite understand the relevant problems, or render with enough subtlty the range of opinions amongst diasporic Jews –– and the dangers of getting the answers wrong. (Relatedly, [Ido Vock's piece in Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev8kxj/how-labour-could-start-to-solve-its-anti-semitism-crisis) is the best article on this subject that I've ever read.)

The LRB occasionally jumps to and revives older texts, like [this review of my favourite Iris Murdoch novel, Under The Net](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n01/michael-wood/don-t-worry-about-the-pronouns). And sometimes [it doesn't review texts at all, but instead tells contemporary people's stories](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n16/patrick-cockburn/endtimes-in-mosul).

Finally, the blogs, which always remain free, are also worth exploring. There's a piece on [Finnis, homosexuality, and academic freedom](https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2019/january/academic-freedom) by Sophie Smith, which helped me see into a blind spot of my liberalism. Or there's this piece on [Landmines in the Sahara](https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2018/september/landmines-in-the-sahara) by an old acquaintance of mine, Matthew Porges; his piece on [Killing a Camel](https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/july/killing-a-camel) is also good. Srinivasan also wrote [a short obituary on Parfitt, which is charming](https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/january/remembering-derek-parfit).
