              <p>December passed by in a blur, with our wedding, my birthday, a lot of travel, and more champagne than I care to mention. I had plenty of time to read and relax, and have found myself in January with a newfound sense of focus and purpose. I am a part of something bigger now. The boundaries of my responsibilities extend beyond myself. I now owe myself, my ambitions, my successes, fully to another person. A conspiracy of two.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Project-Hail-Mary-Andy-Weir/dp/0593135202">Project Hail Mary</a> was fun, although I think it tried to be too smart – the science was a little too complicated in a way that felt unbelievable – which made it a poorer book than the Martian. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X">The Man Who Solved The Market</a> was just interesting enough to get me through a four-hour flight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/publication/a-very-short-guide-to-planning-reform/">A very short guide to planning reform</a>, a useful resource to lean on when YIMBY-proselytising.

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Finished the first draft of my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Ethereum-Products-Protocols-Platforms/dp/1484290445">Building With Ethereum: Products, Protocols, and Platforms</a>, which is now available to pre-order from Amazon. Some minor edits to do and then to production. Other than that, I’ve been enjoying drinking again – more on that soon – and reading, relaxing, resting. I’m taking the rest of the year off to plan and scheme.</p>

<p>Heavy fiction month. The Rest is History <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-history-podcast/185-agatha-christie">prompted me</a> to start reading some Agatha Cristie, so I sat down over the weekend and read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Then-There-Were-None-Favourite/dp/0008123209">And Then There Were None</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murder-Roger-Ackroyd-Poirot/dp/0007527527">The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleeping-Murder-Marple-Agatha-Christie/dp/000819663X">Sleeping Murder</a>. The writing is charming and lovely, and funny, even when grim. You truly get the sense that she’s building these tropes as she goes along, that the structure of the whodunnit genre was falling out of her pen as she went. Totally gripping. I’ve not enjoyed fiction this effortlessly since Station Eleven.</p>

<p>I also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Mars-Kim-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0007310161">Red Mars</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson, a good novel but about 200 pages longer than it needed to be. I find the same problem with most scifi and fantasy. Something about world-building lends itself to self-indulgence? I don’t know.</p>

<p>Reread David Yaffe’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Reckless-Daughter-Portrait-Joni-Mitchell/dp/0374538069">Reckless Daughter</a> in preperation for my Joni Mitchell Interintellect salon, which went well. I put that book down liking her much less as a person and much more as an artist.</p>

<p>An interesting approach to price iteration and programmable pricing structures: <a href="https://priceops.org">theory</a> and <a href="https://www.tier.run">practice</a>.</p>

<p>Some good housing stuff this month too. Much more energy toward this issue in my little corner of the internet. <a href="https://twitter.com/MrSteveDriscoll/status/1587249795428589568">Auckland upzoning reforms working well</a>, causing <a href="https://onefinaleffort.com/auckland">a meaningful decrease in real rents and an increase in affordability</a>.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Writing lots this month, finishing up the manuscript for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Ethereum-Products-Protocols-Platforms/dp/1484290445">Building With Ethereum: Products, Protocols, and Platforms</a>. Decided to restructure it all halfway through the first draft, which has meant a lot of rewriting. I’m learning a lot about how to sustain an argument over ~300 pages, and what makes for clear, technical exposition.</p>

<p>Managed to dash out something small on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/10/09/alphatensor-scaling.html">AlphaTensor and research taste</a>. Since I noticed this taste dynamic, it keeps popping up everywhere. It’s certainly not a new insight, but it’s something I see addressed an unfortunately small amount in the philosophy of science literature. The scientist is taken as some a priori given to most philosophical models of science, which, if my observation is correct, is skipping over perhaps the most important part of the analysis. Feyerabend gestures towards it in Against Method, but, again, doesn’t quite get there.</p>

<p>I’ve also been reading a lot. Winston Churchill’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Early-Life-Winston-Churchill/dp/0907871623">My Early Life</a> was a delightful, charming piece of Kipling-hued imperialism. His world-view is so remote from ours, so free of moral ambiguity. It’s a decidedly Victorian book, of heroes and adventures, a sort of anti-Le Carré. He is a wonderful writer and a gifted storyteller. Well worth a read.</p>

<p>Charles Petzold’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a> was also extremely good. He builds up an intuitive model for digital computing, from the very basics of Morse code via flashlights to complex microprocessors. This was a fill-in-the-gaps book for me, something I could read quickly – I finished it in two days – but has meaningfully added to my basic understanding. I didn’t, for instance, have a clear idea of a CPU’s clock cycle, which this book has changed superlatively. It was funny, too.</p>

<p>Just finished Simon Morden’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Planet-Natural-History-Mars/dp/1783966610/">The Red Planet: A Natural History of Mars</a>, which I’m reading in a cluster with some other Mars books. More top spacey content! Good passages on competing theories of crust formation and covers the basics of the protoplanetary disc super well. Makes me want to write something similar on Saturn (an infinitely more mysterious and beautiful planet.)</p>

<p>And, of course, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cosmos-Cosmic-Evolution-Science-Civilisation/dp/0349107033">Cosmos</a> by Carl Sagan. It has taken me 27 years to read a book that I should have read in my early teens. I felt a flickering rememberance of days past, that wide-eyed, ambitious, weird young boy, trying to understand who he was and why he was so unhappy. If I had read this book then, I suspect I’d be a scientist now – and would have become much more content with my weirdness.</p>

<p>My first Interintellect Salon, <a href="https://interintellect.com/salon/freedom-and-love-in-the-music-of-joni-mitchell/">Freedom and Love in the Music of Joni Mitchell</a> is later this month. Should be wonderfully self-indulgent and fun.</p>

<p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-concrete-vision-of-the-liberal">A concrete vision of the liberal democratic future</a> from Noah Smith, and a more pointed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scarcity-crisis-college-housing-health-care/621221/">piece on the abundance agenda</a>. This quote from Noah stuck with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final thing that the liberal democratic vision needs is a way to accommodate conservatives. The divisions within the democratic world are the primary reason why the autocratic powers are able to make their case at all. But a great many people within any society, including liberal democratic ones, are socially conservative to a greater or lesser degree. If the vision of the future that liberal democracies present is one where conservative values have been wiped from the Earth, then conservatives will feel they have no choice but to embrace reactionary illiberalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from Noah, <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-per-capita-emissions-is-a-bad">why per-capita emissions is a bad framing for the carbon debate</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of anti-EA discourse began in our little corner of the Internet this month. Liam Kofi Bright made a fair point that the evaluative standards of the movement’s critics seem <a href="https://twitter.com/lastpositivist/status/1578695082748055553">radically out-of-whack</a>. David Shor <a href="https://twitter.com/davidshor/status/1578779382545530886">gave a good reply</a> about the psychology of the median EA member (via Nadia). And Nathan <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/effective-altruism#An_attempt_at_a_minimal_set_of_effective_altruism_axioms">put together an attempt at a minimal set of EA axioms</a> that is worth reading.</p>

<p>Really enjoying the <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com">Pedestrian Observations</a> blog, another good example (along with Construction Physics) of the single-issue blog that <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/">Patrick and Tyler discussed</a> back in 2017:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COLLISON: What kinds of blogs should there be more of in the world?</p>

  <p>COWEN: Single-issue blogs on issues of importance. If you take something like penal reform, an underrated cause. Prisons, I think, are barbaric, but it’s not an easy problem to solve. There’s not a quick fix. Some people do need to be constrained in some way. The idea that there should be more blogs that track that and persistently deliver the message, “Something is wrong here.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using hedonic methods I find that wind projects can impose significant external local costs, while solar projects do not. I then show that planning officials are particularly sensitive to local costs in their area. The resulting misallocation of investment may have increased wind power deployment costs by 10-29%.</p>

              <p>Wrapped up my work with Fei Labs this week, and am now unemployed again, poking around the edges of opportunities and building a stronger sense of what I want to work on next. My book on product engineering with Ethereum is coming along well; I should have the first draft done in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I’ve been rewatching <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80025678">The Crown</a>, partly in preparation for the new season, partly to revisit the life of Elizabeth II, and most of all because I have had several casual conversations with friends on various topics in 20th-century British political history, and I wanted a lightweight set of touch points, nudges toward various prime ministers and political events that I might read into more deeply. As a result, almost all of my reading time has been taken up with television. It’s amazing how easily that can happen!</p>

<p>I did, however, manage to reread <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135">Stubborn Attachments</a> by Tyler Cowen. It was much less surprising and enjoyable on rereading, but I suppose that’s a sign of a book whose ideas seem to be more mainstream, whose arguments are more familiar and plausible, whose memes have sunk in to my brain. If I have any criticisms now, it’s that it isn’t ambitious or controversial enough; he caveats the demand for growth by demanding sustainable growth; he builds a broader normative pluralism into a notion of ‘Wealth+’; both of which feel more like a concession to the zeitgeist rather than a serious commitment.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/27/state-adjacent-institutions.html">State-Adjacent Institutions</a></h2>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>From Dominic Cummings’s recent <a href="https://dominiccummings.substack.com/p/snippets-5-no10-farce-ukr-tory-strategy">‘Snippets 5’</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NSN searched for people who wanted to start new schools that we intended to allow under new legislation then worked with them on their application.</p>

  <p>It developed specific ideas for how the system should work. Unlike normal think tanks, it worked at the extreme detail end of the spectrum, like drafting actual forms that the DfE could use.</p>

  <p>We thought that if we helped people develop specific projects and could actually bend the bureaucracy, we could get ‘Free Schools’ going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is interesting, because it suggests a model for <em>state-adjacent</em> institutions that support the functions of the state without being tied to the bureaucracy or subject to the incentives. Something somewhere in the midpoint between a management consultancy, a think tank, and a training institute.</p>

<p>It seems like this sort of model is beneficial in specific circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Where there is considerable state funding for a certain industry / project / goal</strong>, where ‘considerable’ is relative to the industry / project / goal. (You need more money to make a new nuclear power plant design than you do a school.)</li>
  <li><strong>Where access to that funding is reasonably competitive.</strong> This means it needs to be accessible to SMEs or small teams, rather than just Serco, G4S, the major universities, and the other big boys.</li>
  <li><strong>Where the government department distributing the funding is receptive to introductions, advice, support</strong>. A lot of the benefits seem to come from new ideas being introduced revisited through a feedback loop, so the department must be flexible enough to integrate the state-adjacent institution into its decision making – or, at least, leave its door open to such input. Generally, I suspect, departments are only really flexible in this sort of way during their first few years and for a year or two after a major shake-up (eg DoE under Gove).</li>
</ul>

<p>A few ideas where this could be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ‘ARIA Attractor’: finding individuals / teams with audacious projects, helping them refine their proposals, and using the knowledge gained from the search to help shape the department’s broader research focus.</li>
  <li>An analogous attractor for the UKRI / NIH / other ‘normal science’ funding bodies, with an emphasis on speeding up the funding application process.</li>
  <li>Standards setting and guidance for navigating the planning system, but beyond a simple planning consultancy. A team of people who work hard to befriend and effectively lobby local planning teams, giving developers large and small the opportunity to boot up to the activation energy required to get anything built. It would be useful to focus on local authorities with a recent change in governance, or with an especially acute housing problem, where the demand to do something is greater.</li>
  <li>A company to abstract away the medical licensing and compliance process and help guide new teams / University spin-offs to apply for medical licenses. Medical software, in particular, is notoriously hard to get adequate licensing for. A team dedicated to building solutions and increasing governmental awareness of these issues, working with funding bodies and NHS clinical commissioning groups, could meaningfully move the needle on what innovation we permit in the medical space (<a href="https://www.scarletcomply.com">Scarlet</a> are doing interesting things adjacent to this idea.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating and supporting these sorts of state-adjacent institutions could be an important <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pfbLKnJmDKYSPPCEW/four-focus-areas-of-effective-altruism">focus area</a> for a movement like Effective Altruism.</p>

<p>But it could also be a powerful new framing for start-ups themselves: many of these ideas could grow into profitable businesses as well as institutions with positive-sum state/business interactions.</p>

<p>Asking the question “how can the private or non-profit sector smooth over the relationship between the state and others?” is a subtly different question – and one with (in many cases perhaps) more leverage than the simpler question “how can the state do things more effectively?”</p>

<p>Why? Because it refocuses the conversation on what can be done <em>practically</em>, today, without needing large-scale systemic reform, without needing to push through the <a href="https://dominiccummings.com/tag/procurement/">ossified systems of government purchasing</a> and permits that sit in deeply suboptimal equilibria.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>ETHCC Paris, The Idler Festival, dinners at the Liberal Club, work on the book, actual work, and learning to fly; it’s been a busy month in which I deadlifted 100kg for the first time, only read a couple of books, submitted the first few chapters of <strong>Products, Protocols, and Platforms</strong>, and have found myself exhausted. I am more energised when I am productive, and more productive when I am energised, so ascertaining how to bootstrap myself into either productivity or energy is I think a high-leverage activity with which I’ll be experimenting for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing I read this month was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eichmann-Jerusalem-Report-Banality-Evil/dp/024155229X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Eichmann in Jerusalem</a>. I didn’t quite realise how much of a journalist Arendt was, and look forward to reading more of her political theory in the future. It’s rare, nowadays, to go from in-the-trenches journalism to academic theorising. (Counterexamples: Gramsci, sort of? Maybe Robert Caro? Anne Applebaum, perhaps?)</p>

<p>Also supplemented Arendt with Richard Evans’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Third-Reich-Power-1933-Hearts/dp/0141009764">Third Reich in Power</a>, the second volume in the series. I read the first volume maybe a decade ago and enjoyed it. The second was more of a slog.</p>

<p>Just finished <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hard-Drive-Making-Microsoft-Empire/dp/0887306292/ref=sr_1_1?crid=D7B2ZBP7Q351&amp;keywords=hard+drive+bill+gates&amp;qid=1659523562&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=hard+drive+bi%2Cstripbooks%2C798&amp;sr=1-1">Hard Drive</a>, a book about Bill Gates and the early days of Microsoft. Gates was a <em>lot</em> more competitive and ruthless than I thought – and I thought he was pretty competitive and ruthless!</p>

<p>Also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154">All Out War</a> by Tim Shipman. Fantastic political journalism, no agenda, just the steady beat and the sporadic bursts of a battle unfolding.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/johncoogan/status/1546921877586604032">A logarithmic map of the entire universe</a>.</p>

<p>A good post from Tanner <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/the-fall-of-history-as-a-major-and-as-a-part-of-the-humanities/">on the decline of history majors</a> and the relationship between the sciences and the humanities. Also a very well-written letter <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/criq.12675">on decolonising the curriculum</a> and the contradictions inherent in it.</p>

<p>There’s something very distinctive about the ‘long-form interviews with macho men for a predominantly working-to-lower-middle-class white male audience that leans right’ format, and I can’t quite put my finger on what it is. It’s far from anti-intellectualism: the hosts and their guests are smart and eager to grapple with complicated ideas. It’s not quite one-sidedness, because they can surprised you. It’s almost an aesthetic property, a flavour of self-assuredness, the eschewing of the effete. Whatever it is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwK_XLFOm_I">this interview with Erik Prince</a> was swimming in it.</p>

<p>Wonderful lecture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n068fel-W9I">on the F-22 Raptor and the engineering decisions behind it</a>.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>May was a fine month with lots of social engagements, less writing than I wanted, but quite a lot of reading. I ran the Edinburgh Marathon, my first marathon ever, in four hours and 33 minutes. I wrote a piece on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/05/24/decentralisation-is-a-tradeoff-space.html">Decentralisation as a trade-off space</a>.</p>

<p>To prepare for a debate with my friend David, I read two books on the history of housing development: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-That-Solid-Housing-Disaster/dp/1846147158">All That is Solid</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Municipal-Dreams-Rise-Council-Housing/dp/178478740X">Municipal Dreams</a>. The latter was very good. The former descended into Tory-bashing in the key of Owen Jones, which might be righteous but is also a little tiresome. I also read bits of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Order-without-Design-Markets-Cities/dp/0262038765">Order Without Design</a>, which was truly excellent; it’s good to see urban theory that grounds itself in, and has respect for, economics.</p>

<p>I also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diaries-Two-People-Alastair-Campbell/dp/0099493462">the second volume of Alastair Campbell’s diaries</a>, covering 1997-1999 and the first few salvos of a triumphantly New Labour. The diary format is excellent, since you get an obviously singular perspective as it unfolds. I hadn’t realised quite how little communication mattered in the civil service prior to Blair; lots of Campbell’s agonies involved getting various govt departments to coordinate messaging, routing comms through Number 10. I also had very little idea of how much work went into the Good Friday agreement, or how tenuous it was. Many many chances for it to fall apart. Had Paisley or Trimble or Adams woken up on the wrong side of bed on the wrong morning and the whole thing would have been doomed. From inside government policy seems much more chaotic and stochastic than I had suspected (which might be a reason to be less worried, at least on the margin, about <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch tendencies</a>.)</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shadow-Moon-Challenging-Tranquility-1965-1969/dp/B01DJS9E1A">In the Shadow of the Moon</a> while falling asleep most nights, a very thorough set of biographies and history of the Gemini missions, up to Apollo 11.</p>

<p>As for other links, and continuing on the theme of housing, I also read a few good papers worth reading if the subject appeals to you. Anthony Breach’s <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-06-13-Capital-cities-how-the-planning-system-creates-housing-shortages-and-drives-wealth-inequality.pdf">Capital Cities: How the Planning System Creates Housing Shortages and Drives Wealth Inequality</a> was extremely clear and thorough, UK-specific, and perfect for preparing for an argument with David. <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/">The Housing Theory of Everything</a> helps drive home why this matters so much. YIMBY is a moral argument as much as an economic one.</p>

<p>Campbell’s diaries got me on a bit of a New Labour kick, so I watched <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p09wgbfk/blair-brown-the-new-labour-revolution-series-1-episode-1">last year’s excellent series</a> on Blair and Brown and the 13 years of New Labour government. I’ve also been enjoying <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-politics">The Rest is Politics</a> podcast, hosted by Campbell and Rory Stewart.</p>

<p>Dwarkesh Patel wrote a good post on <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/barbell-strategies">applying the ‘Barbell Strategy’ to everyday life</a>: reframing habit formation and intellectual projects in terms of oscillating between intense focus on one thing and the simplest, lowest-effort thing possible –– which is often nothing at all.</p>

<p>Ken Shiriff is writing some truly excellent, deep work on the technical substrate of the Apollo missions. This is <a href="http://www.righto.com/2022/05/talking-with-moon-inside-apollos.html">a post on the premodulation processor</a>, the signal combinator and splitter in the command module.</p>

<p>We can now make clocks <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/02/jila-atomic-clocks-measure-einsteins-general-relativity-millimeter-scale">so sensitive that they can detect the relativistic difference caused by being one milimetre deeper in the Earth’s gravity well</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/blob/main/projects/OPT/chronicles/OPT175B_Logbook.pdf">a logbook documented while building and deploying</a> one of their NLP models. More companies and people should do this sort of stuff.</p>

<p>Finally, I signed a contract with Apress this week to publish a book on Product Engineering on Ethereum. My aim is to raise the relative status of product engineers – those of us who build everything around smart contracts, UIs, tooling, infrastructure – and explore how the unique processing model of Ethereum puts important constraints on the way we build software. I’ll be posting some pieces here as I work through the first draft, so keep an eye out if you’re interested.</p>
