              <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Ethereum-Products-Protocols-Platforms/dp/1484290445">My book is out!</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742">The Mom Test</a> is one of those books that I would never have read if I didn’t need to for work, and was instantly thrilled that I had. Having productive conversations is one of those meta-skills that gets way too little attention but underpins basically every other piece of pedagogy. This book helps you have those conversations.</p>

<p>I’ve been working through many, but not all, of the essays in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adventures-Computational-Explorer-Stephen-Wolfram/dp/1579550266">Adventures of a Computational Explorer</a> by Stephen Wolfram. I suspect we’ll know within 15-20 years whether Wolfram’s big, and somewhat esoteric, scientific bet – that the universe is built bottom-up from the emergent properties of simple computational rules – is true. But many of the essays aren’t about that at all. They present an attractive model for the productive life. (Wolfram sits in roughly the same region of my embedding space as Tyler Cowen for this reason.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1785785508">Dark Matter and Dark Energy: The Hidden 95% of the Universe</a> was interesting, clear, well-written, but like so many of these sorts of books it became rushed at just the same moment that its content got interesting.</p>

<p>I’m still digesting C. P. Snow’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Two-Cultures-Canto-Classics/dp/1107606144">The Two Cultures</a>. I suspect it might be the most important book I will read this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation">Jessica’s work on LLM feature visualisation</a> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SolidGoldMagikarp</code> token was released to, well, quite some acclaim. Cool to have the Rumbelow name known for something other than failed television retailing, Ripperology, ecoactivism, or pompous tech blogging.</p>

<p>I liked this post about <a href="https://apoorvagovind.substack.com/p/how-to-waste-your-career-one-comfortable">ways to waste your early career.</a>. My big takeaway: you can change things.

              <p>December passed by in a blur, with our wedding, my birthday, a lot of travel, and more champagne than I care to mention. I had plenty of time to read and relax, and have found myself in January with a newfound sense of focus and purpose. I am a part of something bigger now. The boundaries of my responsibilities extend beyond myself. I now owe myself, my ambitions, my successes, fully to another person. A conspiracy of two.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Project-Hail-Mary-Andy-Weir/dp/0593135202">Project Hail Mary</a> was fun, although I think it tried to be too smart – the science was a little too complicated in a way that felt unbelievable – which made it a poorer book than the Martian. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X">The Man Who Solved The Market</a> was just interesting enough to get me through a four-hour flight.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Writing lots this month, finishing up the manuscript for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Ethereum-Products-Protocols-Platforms/dp/1484290445">Building With Ethereum: Products, Protocols, and Platforms</a>. Decided to restructure it all halfway through the first draft, which has meant a lot of rewriting. I’m learning a lot about how to sustain an argument over ~300 pages, and what makes for clear, technical exposition.</p>

<p>Managed to dash out something small on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/10/09/alphatensor-scaling.html">AlphaTensor and research taste</a>. Since I noticed this taste dynamic, it keeps popping up everywhere. It’s certainly not a new insight, but it’s something I see addressed an unfortunately small amount in the philosophy of science literature. The scientist is taken as some a priori given to most philosophical models of science, which, if my observation is correct, is skipping over perhaps the most important part of the analysis. Feyerabend gestures towards it in Against Method, but, again, doesn’t quite get there.</p>

<p>I’ve also been reading a lot. Winston Churchill’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Early-Life-Winston-Churchill/dp/0907871623">My Early Life</a> was a delightful, charming piece of Kipling-hued imperialism. His world-view is so remote from ours, so free of moral ambiguity. It’s a decidedly Victorian book, of heroes and adventures, a sort of anti-Le Carré. He is a wonderful writer and a gifted storyteller. Well worth a read.</p>

<p>Charles Petzold’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a> was also extremely good. He builds up an intuitive model for digital computing, from the very basics of Morse code via flashlights to complex microprocessors. This was a fill-in-the-gaps book for me, something I could read quickly – I finished it in two days – but has meaningfully added to my basic understanding. I didn’t, for instance, have a clear idea of a CPU’s clock cycle, which this book has changed superlatively. It was funny, too.</p>

<p>Just finished Simon Morden’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Planet-Natural-History-Mars/dp/1783966610/">The Red Planet: A Natural History of Mars</a>, which I’m reading in a cluster with some other Mars books. More top spacey content! Good passages on competing theories of crust formation and covers the basics of the protoplanetary disc super well. Makes me want to write something similar on Saturn (an infinitely more mysterious and beautiful planet.)</p>

<p>And, of course, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cosmos-Cosmic-Evolution-Science-Civilisation/dp/0349107033">Cosmos</a> by Carl Sagan. It has taken me 27 years to read a book that I should have read in my early teens. I felt a flickering rememberance of days past, that wide-eyed, ambitious, weird young boy, trying to understand who he was and why he was so unhappy. If I had read this book then, I suspect I’d be a scientist now – and would have become much more content with my weirdness.</p>

<p>My first Interintellect Salon, <a href="https://interintellect.com/salon/freedom-and-love-in-the-music-of-joni-mitchell/">Freedom and Love in the Music of Joni Mitchell</a> is later this month. Should be wonderfully self-indulgent and fun.</p>

<p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-concrete-vision-of-the-liberal">A concrete vision of the liberal democratic future</a> from Noah Smith, and a more pointed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scarcity-crisis-college-housing-health-care/621221/">piece on the abundance agenda</a>. This quote from Noah stuck with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final thing that the liberal democratic vision needs is a way to accommodate conservatives. The divisions within the democratic world are the primary reason why the autocratic powers are able to make their case at all. But a great many people within any society, including liberal democratic ones, are socially conservative to a greater or lesser degree. If the vision of the future that liberal democracies present is one where conservative values have been wiped from the Earth, then conservatives will feel they have no choice but to embrace reactionary illiberalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from Noah, <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-per-capita-emissions-is-a-bad">why per-capita emissions is a bad framing for the carbon debate</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of anti-EA discourse began in our little corner of the Internet this month. Liam Kofi Bright made a fair point that the evaluative standards of the movement’s critics seem <a href="https://twitter.com/lastpositivist/status/1578695082748055553">radically out-of-whack</a>. David Shor <a href="https://twitter.com/davidshor/status/1578779382545530886">gave a good reply</a> about the psychology of the median EA member (via Nadia). And Nathan <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/effective-altruism#An_attempt_at_a_minimal_set_of_effective_altruism_axioms">put together an attempt at a minimal set of EA axioms</a> that is worth reading.</p>

<p>Really enjoying the <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com">Pedestrian Observations</a> blog, another good example (along with Construction Physics) of the single-issue blog that <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/">Patrick and Tyler discussed</a> back in 2017:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COLLISON: What kinds of blogs should there be more of in the world?</p>

  <p>COWEN: Single-issue blogs on issues of importance. If you take something like penal reform, an underrated cause. Prisons, I think, are barbaric, but it’s not an easy problem to solve. There’s not a quick fix. Some people do need to be constrained in some way. The idea that there should be more blogs that track that and persistently deliver the message, “Something is wrong here.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A great paper on <a href="https://stephenjarvis.github.io/files/jarvis_jmp_nimbyism_renewable_energy.pdf">The Economic Costs of NIMBYism</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using hedonic methods I find that wind projects can impose significant external local costs, while solar projects do not. I then show that planning officials are particularly sensitive to local costs in their area. The resulting misallocation of investment may have increased wind power deployment costs by 10-29%.</p>

              <p>Found myself in somewhat of a funk this month, low on energy and motivation. My usual menu of neuroses bubbling up and my usual response; fits-and-starts of bouyancy followed by lethargy. Unhappy with my work. I think I need a holiday. And twenty more IQ points.</p>

<p>Anyway, not much writing, just <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/06/27/wallets-as-identity.html">Wallets As Identity</a>, a rough first draft of a chapter from the Ethereum book.</p>

<p>I began five books but only finished one: Feyerabend’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Against-Method-Paul-K-Feyerabend/dp/1844674428">Against Method</a>. I intend to write in more detail about it, because it was both very good and also rather illegible. After some effort, I think I have a clear idea of what he is trying to do, but I can’t see how his arguments don’t collapse into a much broader scepticism. <a href="https://twitter.com/JamieRumbelow/status/1535955057966989313">Here’s a Twitter thread</a> with some quotes I enjoyed.</p>

<p>The unabridged edition of <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/A-History-of-Britain-Volume-1-Audiobook/B0094OI6U4">Simon Schama’s History of Great Britain series</a> is wonderful – Schama writes so well – and it’s currently included with any Audible subscription, although that will change this month.</p>

<p><a href="https://sriramk.com/memos.html">A collection of memos</a> ‘written for an internal audience’, mostly business and technology but some politics too. Diaries and letters and other documentary on how the sausage gets made gives you a good sense for 1. the trade-offs involved in absolutely everything, something that is easy to consider intellectually and much harder to feel intuitively, 2. how chaotic and unregimentable progress is a priori, and 3. the sheer variability of approaches and styles of success and failure.</p>

<p>Michael Nielsen writes on <a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/">effective altruism</a> and his take on its problems providing a moral core for an individual’s life.</p>

<p>A friend pointed me to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1FPKMooGfbOGzESM1G2ffC?si=e2cb4c6bb8d6440b&amp;nd=1">this Dylan B-side</a>, from the Blood on the Tracks sessions. Lovely and sad and detached. Dylan’s narrator is always at arm’s length from his subject, even when he’s singing about himself.</p>

<p>Two useful reviews of The Future of Fusion Energy, <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2022/01/03/future-of-fusion-energy.html">one</a> from Martin Kleppman, <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-future-of-fusion">the other</a> from the Astral Codex Ten book review contest: the former reviews the book, the latter reviews its content.</p>

<p>Toby Ord on <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2104/2104.01191.pdf">the knowability of the Edges of the Universe</a>; and a fun lecture from Stuart Armstrong on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQTfuI-9jIo">how we might get there</a>.</p>

<p>For a bit of context on the jurisprudential questions that underly the Roe v Wade debates, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmv5Tz7w5pk">a chat between Scalia and Breyer</a>.</p>

<p>And here’s a beautiful photograph of a new(-ish; May 2020) impact crater found on Mars:</p>
