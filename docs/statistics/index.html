            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Wrapped up my work with Fei Labs this week, and am now unemployed again, poking around the edges of opportunities and building a stronger sense of what I want to work on next. My book on product engineering with Ethereum is coming along well; I should have the first draft done in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I’ve been rewatching <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80025678">The Crown</a>, partly in preparation for the new season, partly to revisit the life of Elizabeth II, and most of all because I have had several casual conversations with friends on various topics in 20th-century British political history, and I wanted a lightweight set of touch points, nudges toward various prime ministers and political events that I might read into more deeply. As a result, almost all of my reading time has been taken up with television. It’s amazing how easily that can happen!</p>

<p>I did, however, manage to reread <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135">Stubborn Attachments</a> by Tyler Cowen. It was much less surprising and enjoyable on rereading, but I suppose that’s a sign of a book whose ideas seem to be more mainstream, whose arguments are more familiar and plausible, whose memes have sunk in to my brain. If I have any criticisms now, it’s that it isn’t ambitious or controversial enough; he caveats the demand for growth by demanding sustainable growth; he builds a broader normative pluralism into a notion of ‘Wealth+’; both of which feel more like a concession to the zeitgeist rather than a serious commitment.</p>

<p>Somebody fed the lyrics of ‘Imagine’ into an AI and <a href="https://twitter.com/sundellviz/status/1574492250620542980">asked it to write new verses.</a></p>

<p>Another <a href="https://nautil.us/lose-weight-the-slow-and-incredibly-difficult-way-239703/">preposterous and charming post</a> from Randall Munroe: how much of the Earth’s mass would you have to relocate to space in order to lose 20lbs of weight?</p>

<p>Reminder that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9lqW3pQDcUuugXLIpzcUdA">YouTube has some 400 episodes of Buckley’s Firing Line interviews</a>, and they’re still extremely good. (Has anybody put the audio into a podcast stream yet?)</p>
