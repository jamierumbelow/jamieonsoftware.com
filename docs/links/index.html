            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/11/02/links-october-2022.html">Links, October 2022</a></h2>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Writing lots this month, finishing up the manuscript for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Ethereum-Products-Protocols-Platforms/dp/1484290445">Building With Ethereum: Products, Protocols, and Platforms</a>. Decided to restructure it all halfway through the first draft, which has meant a lot of rewriting. I’m learning a lot about how to sustain an argument over ~300 pages, and what makes for clear, technical exposition.</p>

<p>Managed to dash out something small on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/10/09/alphatensor-scaling.html">AlphaTensor and research taste</a>. Since I noticed this taste dynamic, it keeps popping up everywhere. It’s certainly not a new insight, but it’s something I see addressed an unfortunately small amount in the philosophy of science literature. The scientist is taken as some a priori given to most philosophical models of science, which, if my observation is correct, is skipping over perhaps the most important part of the analysis. Feyerabend gestures towards it in Against Method, but, again, doesn’t quite get there.</p>

<p>I’ve also been reading a lot. Winston Churchill’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Early-Life-Winston-Churchill/dp/0907871623">My Early Life</a> was a delightful, charming piece of Kipling-hued imperialism. His world-view is so remote from ours, so free of moral ambiguity. It’s a decidedly Victorian book, of heroes and adventures, a sort of anti-Le Carré. He is a wonderful writer and a gifted storyteller. Well worth a read.</p>

<p>Charles Petzold’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a> was also extremely good. He builds up an intuitive model for digital computing, from the very basics of Morse code via flashlights to complex microprocessors. This was a fill-in-the-gaps book for me, something I could read quickly – I finished it in two days – but has meaningfully added to my basic understanding. I didn’t, for instance, have a clear idea of a CPU’s clock cycle, which this book has changed superlatively. It was funny, too.</p>

<p>Just finished Simon Morden’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Planet-Natural-History-Mars/dp/1783966610/">The Red Planet: A Natural History of Mars</a>, which I’m reading in a cluster with some other Mars books. More top spacey content! Good passages on competing theories of crust formation and covers the basics of the protoplanetary disc super well. Makes me want to write something similar on Saturn (an infinitely more mysterious and beautiful planet.)</p>

<p>And, of course, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cosmos-Cosmic-Evolution-Science-Civilisation/dp/0349107033">Cosmos</a> by Carl Sagan. It has taken me 27 years to read a book that I should have read in my early teens. I felt a flickering rememberance of days past, that wide-eyed, ambitious, weird young boy, trying to understand who he was and why he was so unhappy. If I had read this book then, I suspect I’d be a scientist now – and would have become much more content with my weirdness.</p>

<p>My first Interintellect Salon, <a href="https://interintellect.com/salon/freedom-and-love-in-the-music-of-joni-mitchell/">Freedom and Love in the Music of Joni Mitchell</a> is later this month. Should be wonderfully self-indulgent and fun.</p>

<p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-concrete-vision-of-the-liberal">A concrete vision of the liberal democratic future</a> from Noah Smith, and a more pointed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scarcity-crisis-college-housing-health-care/621221/">piece on the abundance agenda</a>. This quote from Noah stuck with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final thing that the liberal democratic vision needs is a way to accommodate conservatives. The divisions within the democratic world are the primary reason why the autocratic powers are able to make their case at all. But a great many people within any society, including liberal democratic ones, are socially conservative to a greater or lesser degree. If the vision of the future that liberal democracies present is one where conservative values have been wiped from the Earth, then conservatives will feel they have no choice but to embrace reactionary illiberalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from Noah, <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-per-capita-emissions-is-a-bad">why per-capita emissions is a bad framing for the carbon debate</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of anti-EA discourse began in our little corner of the Internet this month. Liam Kofi Bright made a fair point that the evaluative standards of the movement’s critics seem <a href="https://twitter.com/lastpositivist/status/1578695082748055553">radically out-of-whack</a>. David Shor <a href="https://twitter.com/davidshor/status/1578779382545530886">gave a good reply</a> about the psychology of the median EA member (via Nadia). And Nathan <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/effective-altruism#An_attempt_at_a_minimal_set_of_effective_altruism_axioms">put together an attempt at a minimal set of EA axioms</a> that is worth reading.</p>

<p>Really enjoying the <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com">Pedestrian Observations</a> blog, another good example (along with Construction Physics) of the single-issue blog that <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/">Patrick and Tyler discussed</a> back in 2017:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COLLISON: What kinds of blogs should there be more of in the world?</p>

  <p>COWEN: Single-issue blogs on issues of importance. If you take something like penal reform, an underrated cause. Prisons, I think, are barbaric, but it’s not an easy problem to solve. There’s not a quick fix. Some people do need to be constrained in some way. The idea that there should be more blogs that track that and persistently deliver the message, “Something is wrong here.”</p>

  <p>Using hedonic methods I find that wind projects can impose significant external local costs, while solar projects do not. I then show that planning officials are particularly sensitive to local costs in their area. The resulting misallocation of investment may have increased wind power deployment costs by 10-29%.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Wrapped up my work with Fei Labs this week, and am now unemployed again, poking around the edges of opportunities and building a stronger sense of what I want to work on next. My book on product engineering with Ethereum is coming along well; I should have the first draft done in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I’ve been rewatching <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80025678">The Crown</a>, partly in preparation for the new season, partly to revisit the life of Elizabeth II, and most of all because I have had several casual conversations with friends on various topics in 20th-century British political history, and I wanted a lightweight set of touch points, nudges toward various prime ministers and political events that I might read into more deeply. As a result, almost all of my reading time has been taken up with television. It’s amazing how easily that can happen!</p>

<p>I did, however, manage to reread <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135">Stubborn Attachments</a> by Tyler Cowen. It was much less surprising and enjoyable on rereading, but I suppose that’s a sign of a book whose ideas seem to be more mainstream, whose arguments are more familiar and plausible, whose memes have sunk in to my brain. If I have any criticisms now, it’s that it isn’t ambitious or controversial enough; he caveats the demand for growth by demanding sustainable growth; he builds a broader normative pluralism into a notion of ‘Wealth+’; both of which feel more like a concession to the zeitgeist rather than a serious commitment.</p>

<p>Reminder that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9lqW3pQDcUuugXLIpzcUdA">YouTube has some 400 episodes of Buckley’s Firing Line interviews</a>, and they’re still extremely good. (Has anybody put the audio into a podcast stream yet?)</p>

A long and detailed book but interesting ideas and stories on every page.</p>

<p>Continually impressed by <a href="https://press.stripe.com">Stripe Press</a> and thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Where-Flying-Car-Storrs-Hall/dp/1953953182">Where Is My Flying Car?</a> by J.

<p>Also finished <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anarchy-Rise-Fall-India-Company/dp/1408864371">The Anarchy</a> by William Dalrymple. Had the chance to chat to Dalrymple last month and his enthusiasm and perspicuity for this subject is astounding. The EIC was a violent and predictable and transformative institution, but it was at the same time path-dependent and its success subject to utterly unpredictable chance. Every time I read history I’m taken aback by the fragility of the world we’ve inherited.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>ETHCC Paris, The Idler Festival, dinners at the Liberal Club, work on the book, actual work, and learning to fly; it’s been a busy month in which I deadlifted 100kg for the first time, only read a couple of books, submitted the first few chapters of <strong>Products, Protocols, and Platforms</strong>, and have found myself exhausted. I am more energised when I am productive, and more productive when I am energised, so ascertaining how to bootstrap myself into either productivity or energy is I think a high-leverage activity with which I’ll be experimenting for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing I read this month was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eichmann-Jerusalem-Report-Banality-Evil/dp/024155229X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Eichmann in Jerusalem</a>. I didn’t quite realise how much of a journalist Arendt was, and look forward to reading more of her political theory in the future. It’s rare, nowadays, to go from in-the-trenches journalism to academic theorising. (Counterexamples: Gramsci, sort of? Maybe Robert Caro? Anne Applebaum, perhaps?)</p>

<p>Also supplemented Arendt with Richard Evans’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Third-Reich-Power-1933-Hearts/dp/0141009764">Third Reich in Power</a>, the second volume in the series. I read the first volume maybe a decade ago and enjoyed it. The second was more of a slog.</p>

<p>Just finished <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hard-Drive-Making-Microsoft-Empire/dp/0887306292/ref=sr_1_1?crid=D7B2ZBP7Q351&amp;keywords=hard+drive+bill+gates&amp;qid=1659523562&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=hard+drive+bi%2Cstripbooks%2C798&amp;sr=1-1">Hard Drive</a>, a book about Bill Gates and the early days of Microsoft. Gates was a <em>lot</em> more competitive and ruthless than I thought – and I thought he was pretty competitive and ruthless!</p>

<p>Also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154">All Out War</a> by Tim Shipman. Fantastic political journalism, no agenda, just the steady beat and the sporadic bursts of a battle unfolding.</p>

<p>A good post from Tanner <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/the-fall-of-history-as-a-major-and-as-a-part-of-the-humanities/">on the decline of history majors</a> and the relationship between the sciences and the humanities. Also a very well-written letter <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/criq.12675">on decolonising the curriculum</a> and the contradictions inherent in it.</p>

<p>There’s something very distinctive about the ‘long-form interviews with macho men for a predominantly working-to-lower-middle-class white male audience that leans right’ format, and I can’t quite put my finger on what it is. It’s far from anti-intellectualism: the hosts and their guests are smart and eager to grapple with complicated ideas. It’s not quite one-sidedness, because they can surprised you. It’s almost an aesthetic property, a flavour of self-assuredness, the eschewing of the effete. Whatever it is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwK_XLFOm_I">this interview with Erik Prince</a> was swimming in it.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Found myself in somewhat of a funk this month, low on energy and motivation. My usual menu of neuroses bubbling up and my usual response; fits-and-starts of bouyancy followed by lethargy. Unhappy with my work. I think I need a holiday. And twenty more IQ points.</p>

<p>Anyway, not much writing, just <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/06/27/wallets-as-identity.html">Wallets As Identity</a>, a rough first draft of a chapter from the Ethereum book.</p>

<p>I began five books but only finished one: Feyerabend’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Against-Method-Paul-K-Feyerabend/dp/1844674428">Against Method</a>. I intend to write in more detail about it, because it was both very good and also rather illegible. After some effort, I think I have a clear idea of what he is trying to do, but I can’t see how his arguments don’t collapse into a much broader scepticism. <a href="https://twitter.com/JamieRumbelow/status/1535955057966989313">Here’s a Twitter thread</a> with some quotes I enjoyed.</p>

<p>The unabridged edition of <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/A-History-of-Britain-Volume-1-Audiobook/B0094OI6U4">Simon Schama’s History of Great Britain series</a> is wonderful – Schama writes so well – and it’s currently included with any Audible subscription, although that will change this month.</p>

<p><a href="https://sriramk.com/memos.html">A collection of memos</a> ‘written for an internal audience’, mostly business and technology but some politics too. Diaries and letters and other documentary on how the sausage gets made gives you a good sense for 1. the trade-offs involved in absolutely everything, something that is easy to consider intellectually and much harder to feel intuitively, 2. how chaotic and unregimentable progress is a priori, and 3. the sheer variability of approaches and styles of success and failure.</p>

<p>Michael Nielsen writes on <a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/">effective altruism</a> and his take on its problems providing a moral core for an individual’s life.</p>

<p>A friend pointed me to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1FPKMooGfbOGzESM1G2ffC?si=e2cb4c6bb8d6440b&amp;nd=1">this Dylan B-side</a>, from the Blood on the Tracks sessions. Lovely and sad and detached. Dylan’s narrator is always at arm’s length from his subject, even when he’s singing about himself.</p>

<p>Two useful reviews of The Future of Fusion Energy, <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2022/01/03/future-of-fusion-energy.html">one</a> from Martin Kleppman, <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-future-of-fusion">the other</a> from the Astral Codex Ten book review contest: the former reviews the book, the latter reviews its content.</p>

<p>Toby Ord on <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2104/2104.01191.pdf">the knowability of the Edges of the Universe</a>; and a fun lecture from Stuart Armstrong on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQTfuI-9jIo">how we might get there</a>.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>May was a fine month with lots of social engagements, less writing than I wanted, but quite a lot of reading. I ran the Edinburgh Marathon, my first marathon ever, in four hours and 33 minutes. I wrote a piece on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/05/24/decentralisation-is-a-tradeoff-space.html">Decentralisation as a trade-off space</a>.</p>

<p>To prepare for a debate with my friend David, I read two books on the history of housing development: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-That-Solid-Housing-Disaster/dp/1846147158">All That is Solid</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Municipal-Dreams-Rise-Council-Housing/dp/178478740X">Municipal Dreams</a>. The latter was very good. The former descended into Tory-bashing in the key of Owen Jones, which might be righteous but is also a little tiresome. I also read bits of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Order-without-Design-Markets-Cities/dp/0262038765">Order Without Design</a>, which was truly excellent; it’s good to see urban theory that grounds itself in, and has respect for, economics.</p>

<p>I also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diaries-Two-People-Alastair-Campbell/dp/0099493462">the second volume of Alastair Campbell’s diaries</a>, covering 1997-1999 and the first few salvos of a triumphantly New Labour. The diary format is excellent, since you get an obviously singular perspective as it unfolds. I hadn’t realised quite how little communication mattered in the civil service prior to Blair; lots of Campbell’s agonies involved getting various govt departments to coordinate messaging, routing comms through Number 10. I also had very little idea of how much work went into the Good Friday agreement, or how tenuous it was. Many many chances for it to fall apart. Had Paisley or Trimble or Adams woken up on the wrong side of bed on the wrong morning and the whole thing would have been doomed. From inside government policy seems much more chaotic and stochastic than I had suspected (which might be a reason to be less worried, at least on the margin, about <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch tendencies</a>.)</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shadow-Moon-Challenging-Tranquility-1965-1969/dp/B01DJS9E1A">In the Shadow of the Moon</a> while falling asleep most nights, a very thorough set of biographies and history of the Gemini missions, up to Apollo 11.</p>

<p>As for other links, and continuing on the theme of housing, I also read a few good papers worth reading if the subject appeals to you. Anthony Breach’s <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-06-13-Capital-cities-how-the-planning-system-creates-housing-shortages-and-drives-wealth-inequality.pdf">Capital Cities: How the Planning System Creates Housing Shortages and Drives Wealth Inequality</a> was extremely clear and thorough, UK-specific, and perfect for preparing for an argument with David. <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/">The Housing Theory of Everything</a> helps drive home why this matters so much. YIMBY is a moral argument as much as an economic one.</p>

<p>Campbell’s diaries got me on a bit of a New Labour kick, so I watched <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p09wgbfk/blair-brown-the-new-labour-revolution-series-1-episode-1">last year’s excellent series</a> on Blair and Brown and the 13 years of New Labour government. I’ve also been enjoying <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-politics">The Rest is Politics</a> podcast, hosted by Campbell and Rory Stewart.</p>

<p>Dwarkesh Patel wrote a good post on <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/barbell-strategies">applying the ‘Barbell Strategy’ to everyday life</a>: reframing habit formation and intellectual projects in terms of oscillating between intense focus on one thing and the simplest, lowest-effort thing possible –– which is often nothing at all.</p>

<p>Ken Shiriff is writing some truly excellent, deep work on the technical substrate of the Apollo missions. This is <a href="http://www.righto.com/2022/05/talking-with-moon-inside-apollos.html">a post on the premodulation processor</a>, the signal combinator and splitter in the command module.</p>

<p>We can now make clocks <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/02/jila-atomic-clocks-measure-einsteins-general-relativity-millimeter-scale">so sensitive that they can detect the relativistic difference caused by being one milimetre deeper in the Earth’s gravity well</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/blob/main/projects/OPT/chronicles/OPT175B_Logbook.pdf">a logbook documented while building and deploying</a> one of their NLP models. More companies and people should do this sort of stuff.</p>

<p>Finally, I signed a contract with Apress this week to publish a book on Product Engineering on Ethereum. My aim is to raise the relative status of product engineers – those of us who build everything around smart contracts, UIs, tooling, infrastructure – and explore how the unique processing model of Ethereum puts important constraints on the way we build software. I’ll be posting some pieces here as I work through the first draft, so keep an eye out if you’re interested.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>April has been busy and changeable – mirroring the weather, I suppose – I began a new role at <a href="https://fei.money">Fei Labs</a> and am getting settled. I wrote three pieces on this blog: something technical on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/04/02/hd-wallets-and-network-switching.html">HD wallets and network switching</a>, something equally technical <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/04/03/a-quick-note-on-web_accessible_resources-in-Safari-Web-Extensions.html">about Safari iOS extensions</a>, and the aforementioned <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/04/06/solidity-fridays-transmissions11.html">notes on the t11s episode of Solidity Fridays</a>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my own contributions, this was a good month for interesting reading. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Star-Builders-Nuclear-Fusion-Planet/dp/1474611583">The Star Builders</a> is a very accessible and fast read on the why and how of nuclear fusion. It’s a contribution to the – I think underrated – genre of “here’s a plausible pathway to some major scientific discovery, and a set of good reasons to be optimistic we’re on that pathway” science writing. One for the techno-optimists’ bookshelves.</p>

<p>Emily St. John Mandel’s new novel, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sea-Tranquility-Emily-John-Mandel/dp/1529083494">Sea of Tranquility</a>, is out, and is splendid. I found some of the science fiction elements a little bit hamfisted, and this is definitely Mandel finding her voice and her groove. But it’s worth reading, especially if you’ve read Station Eleven (one of the best novels I’ve read in the last few years) and The Glass Hotel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seven-Brief-Lessons-Physics-Rovelli/dp/0141981725/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1651344159&amp;sr=1-1">Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</a> was enjoyable, too. Best supplemented by something more technical, I think.</p>

<p>Finally, I just finished <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/London-Under-Peter-Ackroyd/dp/0099287374">London Under</a> by Peter Ackroyd. I <em>loved</em> Ackroyd’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Thomas-More-Peter-Ackroyd/dp/0749386401">biography of Sir Thomas More</a>, but hadn’t read any of his other books. He’s an excellent writer. There were a handful of places where I thought he made non-sequiturs – the sort of non-sequiturs quite common in a certain style of proto-academic culture writing – but I’m being really picky.</p>

<p>The excellent Noah Smith did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaMgZSd3gV4">an interview</a> with the excellent David Roberts on climate change, climate tech, climate activism, writing in public. Both combative and thoughtful throughout.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tracers-in-the-dark-welcome-to-video-crypto-anonymity-myth/">challenging post on child abuse videos</a> and a global coordinated effort to bust a specific site and its clients. A long and difficult read but very worthwhile.</p>

<p>Something to keep an eye on – an economics lab <a href="https://start.edgeryders.eu/page/15452">imaginging systems through science-fiction</a>.</p>

<p>In case you’ve woken in a sweat, panicked that you’re not subscribed to enough substacks (subsstack?), <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30983517">here’s a list</a> of good, subject-specific newsletters.</p>

<p>Very very good and comprehensive and thorough <a href="https://cdrprimer.org/read">guide to direct carbon renewal</a>. We need to do more here; Stripe and others have <a href="https://frontierclimate.com">launched an advanced market commitment to help</a>.</p>

<p>Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/expanding-global-payouts-with-crypto">have also launched crypto payments</a>.</p>

<p>The beginning of the conversation, not the end of it, but <a href="https://austinvernon.site/blog/starshipsuperweapon.html">some reflections on SpaceX’s technologies and warfare</a>.</p>

<p>Really enjoyed <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/londons-lost-ringways/">this article on the urban history and development of London’s planned and, blisfully, abandoned Ringways</a>, the persistence of political structures and the perversity of political incentives, and the pitfalls of top-down urban planning. Works in Progress is putting out a lot of excellent stuff.</p>

<p>On top of my normal reading, I listened to three audiobooks this month, all spacey or science-related content. Another for the techno-optimist bookshelf, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Case-Space-Revolution-Spaceflight-Possibility/dp/B08CVTT36C">The Case for Space by Zubrin</a> was good fun, opinionated, rigorous and rather inspiring.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Forces-of-Nature/dp/B01NA0F2DD">Forces of Nature</a>, from the same authorship of The Planets (mentioned last month), was also splendid. The narrator is truly excellent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/080322639X">Into That Silent Sea: Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961-1965 by French and Burgess</a> is part of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B088T4M553">a broader series</a> of histories on various topics in spaceflight. The whole series is pretty good, with only a few exceptions, and this isn’t one of them. Meticulous and narrative-driven, I learnt a lot about Gagarin, Leonov, the Mercury Seven, and the politics that made it all happen. I’ll be continuing this series.</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://calendly.com/jamierumbelow">finally got a Calendly set up</a>, so if you’d like to chat, feel free to book in a call.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>A lot of spacey content this month, and a lot of crypto, as I left my old job at Pactio and moved into crypto full-time:</p>

<p>Finally got round to reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Value-must-read-politics-economics-Governor/dp/0008421099">Values by Mark Carney.</a> Seesaws from economic theory to memoir in a not-uninteresting way. Carney writes well, but sets things up in such a manner as to make his premises seem more interesting than this conclusions. A very safe book. I imagine he’s going to run for public office in Canada some time soon.</p>

<p>Also enjoyed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Law-Venture-Capital-Making/dp/052555999X">The Power Law by Sebastian Mallaby</a>. Clean writing, thoroughly researched.</p>

<p>Curricula for self-teaching <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/math">maths</a> and <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics">physics</a> from Susan Rigetti.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/03/09/enthusiastic-amateurs.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/03/10/enthusiastic-amateurs-some-tips.html">posts</a> on being an enthusiastic amateur.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/space/james-webb-telescope-first-images/">first test image from the James Webb Telescope</a>, of the star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope#Commissioning_and_testing">HD 84406</a> is pretty spectacular (and even more so the more you learn about it.) You can clearly see the spiralling of the galaxies in the background, each one comprising on average 100 billion stars, and many of them billions of lightyears away. The scale of space is very hard to comprehend.</p>

<p>Nadia Eghbal <a href="https://nayafia.substack.com/p/out-of-the-valley">is writing again</a>, which is always a joyous event, this first new essay a gesture toward a broader project on philanthropy and the tech industry. Her prose is both incisive and imagistic, twisting and deforming ideas in the best way possible, finding their veins, snapping them like kindling.</p>

<p>An essay on <a href="https://handsandcities.com/2022/01/30/on-infinite-ethics/">infinite ethics</a>, an approach to ethics that takes the existence of infinites seriously, and how infinity fits into the logical structure of existing mainstream ethical theories.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/9lines.html">All of physics in nine lines</a>. I’m surprised the basic theoretical scheme of physics is so parsimonious. (Although it might not <strong>actually</strong> be that parsimonious and this is expository slight-of-hand. What, for instance, explains why there are 27 constants?)</p>

<p>A fun collection of <a href="https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20">weird ERC-20 contracts</a>, mostly exploits or incompatibilities with conventions.</p>

<p>I enjoyed watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58eKnYR_EyM">this episode of Solidity Fridays</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/transmissions11">transmissions11</a>. He articulates trade-offs very well. I took voluminous notes that I’ll type up soon.</p>

<p>On top of my normal reading, I listened to three audiobooks this month. The first, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Spacefarers-Humans-Will-Settle-Beyond/dp/067498448X">Spacefarers by Christopher Wanjek</a>, is freely available to Audible subscribers, and a smart and deeply technical look about the next thousand years of spaceflight.</p>

<p>The second, <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Planets-Audiobook/0008294313">The Planets by Andrew Cohen and Brian Cox</a>, is a book about the history and physics of the Solar System, a companion to the 2019 BBC television series (which is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p06qj2l5/the-planets-series-1-1-a-moment-in-the-sun-the-terrestrial-planets">itself really excellent</a>.) Samuel West’s narration is extremely good, and Cohen is a talented science writer.</p>

<p>The third, also <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Search-for-Exoplanets-What-Astronomers-Know-Audiobook/B0159LVSNC">available for free on Audible</a>, was a collection of Scientific American articles about Exoplanets. The article format is helpful, and the narrator’s voice is just monotonal enough to fall asleep to.</p>

<p>Emily St. John Mandel wrote <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/59815561-station-eleven/30386465-emily-mandel">a series of notes on GoodReads</a>, discussing various passages from her excellent novel Station Eleven.</p>

<p>Vitalik on <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/29/road.html">the roads not taken</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2022/03/27/the-user-experience-problems-of-quadratic-voting/">The user experience problems of quadratic voting.</a> It’s easy to evaluate an approach to some problem in terms of its technical feasibility, or how attractive it is with respect to various theoretical constraints. A lot of the time, its success hinges simply on whether people can understand it.</p>

<p>A very, very good blog post on <a href="https://policyskeptic.blogspot.com/2022/03/the-biggest-problem-holding-back-nhs.html">NHS performance</a>. We need more LessWrong-style analyses of British government policy.</p>
