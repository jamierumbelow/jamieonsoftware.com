            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/05/01/links-april-2022.html">Links, April 2022</a></h2>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>April has been busy and changeable – mirroring the weather, I suppose – I began a new role at <a href="https://fei.money">Fei Labs</a> and am getting settled. I wrote three pieces on this blog: something technical on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/04/02/hd-wallets-and-network-switching.html">HD wallets and network switching</a>, something equally technical <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/04/03/a-quick-note-on-web_accessible_resources-in-Safari-Web-Extensions.html">about Safari iOS extensions</a>, and the aforementioned <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/04/06/solidity-fridays-transmissions11.html">notes on the t11s episode of Solidity Fridays</a>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my own contributions, this was a good month for interesting reading. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Star-Builders-Nuclear-Fusion-Planet/dp/1474611583">The Star Builders</a> is a very accessible and fast read on the why and how of nuclear fusion. It’s a contribution to the – I think underrated – genre of “here’s a plausible pathway to some major scientific discovery, and a set of good reasons to be optimistic we’re on that pathway” science writing. One for the techno-optimists’ bookshelves.</p>

<p>Emily St. John Mandel’s new novel, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sea-Tranquility-Emily-John-Mandel/dp/1529083494">Sea of Tranquility</a>, is out, and is splendid. I found some of the science fiction elements a little bit hamfisted, and this is definitely Mandel finding her voice and her groove. But it’s worth reading, especially if you’ve read Station Eleven (one of the best novels I’ve read in the last few years) and The Glass Hotel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seven-Brief-Lessons-Physics-Rovelli/dp/0141981725/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1651344159&amp;sr=1-1">Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</a> was enjoyable, too. Best supplemented by something more technical, I think.</p>

<p>Finally, I just finished <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/London-Under-Peter-Ackroyd/dp/0099287374">London Under</a> by Peter Ackroyd. I <em>loved</em> Ackroyd’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Thomas-More-Peter-Ackroyd/dp/0749386401">biography of Sir Thomas More</a>, but hadn’t read any of his other books. He’s an excellent writer. There were a handful of places where I thought he made non-sequiturs – the sort of non-sequiturs quite common in a certain style of proto-academic culture writing – but I’m being really picky.</p>

<p>The excellent Noah Smith did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaMgZSd3gV4">an interview</a> with the excellent David Roberts on climate change, climate tech, climate activism, writing in public. Both combative and thoughtful throughout.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tracers-in-the-dark-welcome-to-video-crypto-anonymity-myth/">challenging post on child abuse videos</a> and a global coordinated effort to bust a specific site and its clients. A long and difficult read but very worthwhile.</p>

<p>Something to keep an eye on – an economics lab <a href="https://start.edgeryders.eu/page/15452">imaginging systems through science-fiction</a>.</p>

<p>In case you’ve woken in a sweat, panicked that you’re not subscribed to enough substacks (subsstack?), <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30983517">here’s a list</a> of good, subject-specific newsletters.</p>

<p>Very very good and comprehensive and thorough <a href="https://cdrprimer.org/read">guide to direct carbon renewal</a>. We need to do more here; Stripe and others have <a href="https://frontierclimate.com">launched an advanced market commitment to help</a>.</p>

<p>Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/expanding-global-payouts-with-crypto">have also launched crypto payments</a>.</p>

<p>The beginning of the conversation, not the end of it, but <a href="https://austinvernon.site/blog/starshipsuperweapon.html">some reflections on SpaceX’s technologies and warfare</a>.</p>

<p>Really enjoyed <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/londons-lost-ringways/">this article on the urban history and development of London’s planned and, blisfully, abandoned Ringways</a>, the persistence of political structures and the perversity of political incentives, and the pitfalls of top-down urban planning. Works in Progress is putting out a lot of excellent stuff.</p>

<p>On top of my normal reading, I listened to three audiobooks this month, all spacey or science-related content. Another for the techno-optimist bookshelf, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Case-Space-Revolution-Spaceflight-Possibility/dp/B08CVTT36C">The Case for Space by Zubrin</a> was good fun, opinionated, rigorous and rather inspiring.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Forces-of-Nature/dp/B01NA0F2DD">Forces of Nature</a>, from the same authorship of The Planets (mentioned last month), was also splendid. The narrator is truly excellent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/080322639X">Into That Silent Sea: Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961-1965 by French and Burgess</a> is part of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B088T4M553">a broader series</a> of histories on various topics in spaceflight. The whole series is pretty good, with only a few exceptions, and this isn’t one of them. Meticulous and narrative-driven, I learnt a lot about Gagarin, Leonov, the Mercury Seven, and the politics that made it all happen. I’ll be continuing this series.</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://calendly.com/jamierumbelow">finally got a Calendly set up</a>, so if you’d like to chat, feel free to book in a call.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>A lot of spacey content this month, and a lot of crypto, as I left my old job at Pactio and moved into crypto full-time:</p>

<p>Finally got round to reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Value-must-read-politics-economics-Governor/dp/0008421099">Values by Mark Carney.</a> Seesaws from economic theory to memoir in a not-uninteresting way. Carney writes well, but sets things up in such a manner as to make his premises seem more interesting than this conclusions. A very safe book. I imagine he’s going to run for public office in Canada some time soon.</p>

<p>Also enjoyed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Law-Venture-Capital-Making/dp/052555999X">The Power Law by Sebastian Mallaby</a>. Clean writing, thoroughly researched.</p>

<p>Curricula for self-teaching <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/math">maths</a> and <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics">physics</a> from Susan Rigetti.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/03/09/enthusiastic-amateurs.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/03/10/enthusiastic-amateurs-some-tips.html">posts</a> on being an enthusiastic amateur.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/space/james-webb-telescope-first-images/">first test image from the James Webb Telescope</a>, of the star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope#Commissioning_and_testing">HD 84406</a> is pretty spectacular (and even more so the more you learn about it.) You can clearly see the spiralling of the galaxies in the background, each one comprising on average 100 billion stars, and many of them billions of lightyears away. The scale of space is very hard to comprehend.</p>

<p>Nadia Eghbal <a href="https://nayafia.substack.com/p/out-of-the-valley">is writing again</a>, which is always a joyous event, this first new essay a gesture toward a broader project on philanthropy and the tech industry. Her prose is both incisive and imagistic, twisting and deforming ideas in the best way possible, finding their veins, snapping them like kindling.</p>

<p>An essay on <a href="https://handsandcities.com/2022/01/30/on-infinite-ethics/">infinite ethics</a>, an approach to ethics that takes the existence of infinites seriously, and how infinity fits into the logical structure of existing mainstream ethical theories.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/9lines.html">All of physics in nine lines</a>. I’m surprised the basic theoretical scheme of physics is so parsimonious. (Although it might not <strong>actually</strong> be that parsimonious and this is expository slight-of-hand. What, for instance, explains why there are 27 constants?)</p>

<p>A fun collection of <a href="https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20">weird ERC-20 contracts</a>, mostly exploits or incompatibilities with conventions.</p>

<p>I enjoyed watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58eKnYR_EyM">this episode of Solidity Fridays</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/transmissions11">transmissions11</a>. He articulates trade-offs very well. I took voluminous notes that I’ll type up soon.</p>

<p>On top of my normal reading, I listened to three audiobooks this month. The first, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Spacefarers-Humans-Will-Settle-Beyond/dp/067498448X">Spacefarers by Christopher Wanjek</a>, is freely available to Audible subscribers, and a smart and deeply technical look about the next thousand years of spaceflight.</p>

<p>The second, <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Planets-Audiobook/0008294313">The Planets by Andrew Cohen and Brian Cox</a>, is a book about the history and physics of the Solar System, a companion to the 2019 BBC television series (which is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p06qj2l5/the-planets-series-1-1-a-moment-in-the-sun-the-terrestrial-planets">itself really excellent</a>.) Samuel West’s narration is extremely good, and Cohen is a talented science writer.</p>

<p>The third, also <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Search-for-Exoplanets-What-Astronomers-Know-Audiobook/B0159LVSNC">available for free on Audible</a>, was a collection of Scientific American articles about Exoplanets. The article format is helpful, and the narrator’s voice is just monotonal enough to fall asleep to.</p>

<p>Emily St. John Mandel wrote <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/59815561-station-eleven/30386465-emily-mandel">a series of notes on GoodReads</a>, discussing various passages from her excellent novel Station Eleven.</p>

<p>Vitalik on <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/29/road.html">the roads not taken</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2022/03/27/the-user-experience-problems-of-quadratic-voting/">The user experience problems of quadratic voting.</a> It’s easy to evaluate an approach to some problem in terms of its technical feasibility, or how attractive it is with respect to various theoretical constraints. A lot of the time, its success hinges simply on whether people can understand it.</p>

<p>A very, very good blog post on <a href="https://policyskeptic.blogspot.com/2022/03/the-biggest-problem-holding-back-nhs.html">NHS performance</a>. We need more LessWrong-style analyses of British government policy.</p>
