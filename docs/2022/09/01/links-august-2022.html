            <p>Richard Rhodes’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes/dp/1471111237/">The Making of the Atomic Bomb</a> was the highlight this month, a detailed and incredibly scientifically literate story of the agglomeration effects of genius and the construction of the atomic age. A long and detailed book but interesting ideas and stories on every page.</p>

<p>Continually impressed by <a href="https://press.stripe.com">Stripe Press</a> and thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Where-Flying-Car-Storrs-Hall/dp/1953953182">Where Is My Flying Car?</a> by J. Storrs Hall. We need more techno-optimistic books. Hope and ambition are technologies too, and should be developed and promoted.</p>

<p>Also finished <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anarchy-Rise-Fall-India-Company/dp/1408864371">The Anarchy</a> by William Dalrymple. Had the chance to chat to Dalrymple last month and his enthusiasm and perspicuity for this subject is astounding. The EIC was a violent and predictable and transformative institution, but it was at the same time path-dependent and its success subject to utterly unpredictable chance. Every time I read history I’m taken aback by the fragility of the world we’ve inherited.</p>

<p>The US <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/us-regulators-will-certify-first-small-nuclear-reactor-design">approved a small nuclear reactor design</a>.</p>

<p>Noah Smith on <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/industrial-policy-starts-with-semiconductors">CHIPS and chips</a>, and <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/four-reasons-why-gdp-is-a-useful">four reasons why GDP is a useful number</a>.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f166369.pdf">Knowledge spillovers in Silicon Valley</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our IV approach estimates substantial returns to face-to-face meetings with overidentification tests suggesting we are capturing the returns to serendipity that play a central role in the urban theories of Jane Jacobs.</p>

<p>Some good Visa threads on a cluster of related ideas: <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1436393464468369408">do what you want to do</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1199907654602125312">do it a lot</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1455243916773494784">tell others to do what they want to do</a>. I had a great chat with Visa at Future Forum, and his temper and mode and writing is lovely in a happy-go-lucky, auto-optimistic kind of way. <a href="http://www.visakanv.com/blog/">His blog</a> is also excellent.</p>
