I have managed to read &lt;em&gt;zero books&lt;/em&gt; this month, which isn’t great. I’ll do better in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of good best-of-2022 threads: one on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arnauddyevre/status/1609160058448887808?s=46&amp;amp;t=f7jMAhdBTraiXOsYebkRwQ&quot;&gt;economics of growth/firms papers&lt;/a&gt;, Davis Kedrosky’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dkedrosky/status/1609240961745588228&quot;&gt;favourite books&lt;/a&gt;, and Erik Thorenberg’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1609703100394393600?s=46&amp;amp;t=698SPPgzbhBtEICkAcmN-w&quot;&gt;favourite podcast episodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zvi on Patrick Mackenzie on VaccinateCA. And the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506221098921&quot;&gt;This was interesting&lt;/a&gt;: people who are born poor and become rich tend to be less sympathetic to the poor than those who are born rich.

&lt;p&gt;Francis Galton tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://galton.org/essays/1890-1899/galton-1894-smell.pdf&quot;&gt;perform arithemetic by smell&lt;/a&gt;. Reminds me somewhat of Chapter 2 of Strawson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Individuals-descriptive-metaphysics-P-F-Strawson/dp/0415051851&quot;&gt;Individuals&lt;/a&gt;, where Strawson manages to derive spaciotemporal concepts from auditory input alone. (In fact, it’s a useful mental trick for idea generation: does some context C’ have the resources to support some activity X that is normally performed in context C?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastic thread &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang/status/1613977673067540480&quot;&gt;on the Korean Jeonse system&lt;/a&gt;. (File this under the category of ‘social/legal systems very different from our own’)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really enjoying using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arc.net/&quot;&gt;Arc Browser&lt;/a&gt;, so much so that it’s now my default browser.

Some minor edits to do and then to production. Other than that, I’ve been enjoying drinking again – more on that soon – and reading, relaxing, resting. I’m taking the rest of the year off to plan and scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavy fiction month. The Rest is History &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-history-podcast/185-agatha-christie&quot;&gt;prompted me&lt;/a&gt; to start reading some Agatha Cristie, so I sat down over the weekend and read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Then-There-Were-None-Favourite/dp/0008123209&quot;&gt;And Then There Were None&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murder-Roger-Ackroyd-Poirot/dp/0007527527&quot;&gt;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleeping-Murder-Marple-Agatha-Christie/dp/000819663X&quot;&gt;Sleeping Murder&lt;/a&gt;. The writing is charming and lovely, and funny, even when grim. You truly get the sense that she’s building these tropes as she goes along, that the structure of the whodunnit genre was falling out of her pen as she went. Totally gripping. I’ve not enjoyed fiction this effortlessly since Station Eleven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Mars-Kim-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0007310161&quot;&gt;Red Mars&lt;/a&gt; by Kim Stanley Robinson, a good novel but about 200 pages longer than it needed to be. I find the same problem with most scifi and fantasy. Something about world-building lends itself to self-indulgence? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reread David Yaffe’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Reckless-Daughter-Portrait-Joni-Mitchell/dp/0374538069&quot;&gt;Reckless Daughter&lt;/a&gt; in preperation for my Joni Mitchell Interintellect salon, which went well. I put that book down liking her much less as a person and much more as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good housing stuff this month too. Much more energy toward this issue in my little corner of the internet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MrSteveDriscoll/status/1587249795428589568&quot;&gt;Auckland upzoning reforms working well&lt;/a&gt;, causing &lt;a href=&quot;https://onefinaleffort.com/auckland&quot;&gt;a meaningful decrease in real rents and an increase in affordability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Decided to restructure it all halfway through the first draft, which has meant a lot of rewriting. I’m learning a lot about how to sustain an argument over ~300 pages, and what makes for clear, technical exposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed to dash out something small on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/10/09/alphatensor-scaling.html&quot;&gt;AlphaTensor and research taste&lt;/a&gt;. Since I noticed this taste dynamic, it keeps popping up everywhere. It’s certainly not a new insight, but it’s something I see addressed an unfortunately small amount in the philosophy of science literature. The scientist is taken as some a priori given to most philosophical models of science, which, if my observation is correct, is skipping over perhaps the most important part of the analysis. Feyerabend gestures towards it in Against Method, but, again, doesn’t quite get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been reading a lot. Winston Churchill’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Early-Life-Winston-Churchill/dp/0907871623&quot;&gt;My Early Life&lt;/a&gt; was a delightful, charming piece of Kipling-hued imperialism. His world-view is so remote from ours, so free of moral ambiguity. It’s a decidedly Victorian book, of heroes and adventures, a sort of anti-Le Carré. He is a wonderful writer and a gifted storyteller. Well worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Petzold’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319&quot;&gt;Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software&lt;/a&gt; was also extremely good. He builds up an intuitive model for digital computing, from the very basics of Morse code via flashlights to complex microprocessors. This was a fill-in-the-gaps book for me, something I could read quickly – I finished it in two days – but has meaningfully added to my basic understanding. I didn’t, for instance, have a clear idea of a CPU’s clock cycle, which this book has changed superlatively. It was funny, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just finished Simon Morden’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Planet-Natural-History-Mars/dp/1783966610/&quot;&gt;The Red Planet: A Natural History of Mars&lt;/a&gt;, which I’m reading in a cluster with some other Mars books. More top spacey content! Good passages on competing theories of crust formation and covers the basics of the protoplanetary disc super well. Makes me want to write something similar on Saturn (an infinitely more mysterious and beautiful planet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cosmos-Cosmic-Evolution-Science-Civilisation/dp/0349107033&quot;&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt; by Carl Sagan. It has taken me 27 years to read a book that I should have read in my early teens. I felt a flickering rememberance of days past, that wide-eyed, ambitious, weird young boy, trying to understand who he was and why he was so unhappy. If I had read this book then, I suspect I’d be a scientist now – and would have become much more content with my weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first Interintellect Salon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://interintellect.com/salon/freedom-and-love-in-the-music-of-joni-mitchell/&quot;&gt;Freedom and Love in the Music of Joni Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; is later this month. Should be wonderfully self-indulgent and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-concrete-vision-of-the-liberal&quot;&gt;A concrete vision of the liberal democratic future&lt;/a&gt; from Noah Smith, and a more pointed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scarcity-crisis-college-housing-health-care/621221/&quot;&gt;piece on the abundance agenda&lt;/a&gt;. This quote from Noah stuck with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The final thing that the liberal democratic vision needs is a way to accommodate conservatives. The divisions within the democratic world are the primary reason why the autocratic powers are able to make their case at all. But a great many people within any society, including liberal democratic ones, are socially conservative to a greater or lesser degree. If the vision of the future that liberal democracies present is one where conservative values have been wiped from the Earth, then conservatives will feel they have no choice but to embrace reactionary illiberalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also from Noah, &lt;a href=&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-per-capita-emissions-is-a-bad&quot;&gt;why per-capita emissions is a bad framing for the carbon debate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of anti-EA discourse began in our little corner of the Internet this month. Liam Kofi Bright made a fair point that the evaluative standards of the movement’s critics seem &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lastpositivist/status/1578695082748055553&quot;&gt;radically out-of-whack&lt;/a&gt;. David Shor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidshor/status/1578779382545530886&quot;&gt;gave a good reply&lt;/a&gt; about the psychology of the median EA member (via Nadia). And Nathan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/effective-altruism#An_attempt_at_a_minimal_set_of_effective_altruism_axioms&quot;&gt;put together an attempt at a minimal set of EA axioms&lt;/a&gt; that is worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really enjoying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pedestrianobservations.com&quot;&gt;Pedestrian Observations&lt;/a&gt; blog, another good example (along with Construction Physics) of the single-issue blog that &lt;a href=&quot;https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/&quot;&gt;Patrick and Tyler discussed&lt;/a&gt; back in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;COLLISON: What kinds of blogs should there be more of in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;COWEN: Single-issue blogs on issues of importance. If you take something like penal reform, an underrated cause. Prisons, I think, are barbaric, but it’s not an easy problem to solve. There’s not a quick fix. Some people do need to be constrained in some way. The idea that there should be more blogs that track that and persistently deliver the message, “Something is wrong here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Using hedonic methods I find that wind projects can impose significant external local costs, while solar projects do not. I then show that planning officials are particularly sensitive to local costs in their area. The resulting misallocation of investment may have increased wind power deployment costs by 10-29%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their approach is a variant of the deep reinforcement-learning-guided Monte Carlo tree search that they have applied so successfully to playing Chess and Go. What they have done, very effectively, is to design a game with the objective of finding the most efficient tensor multiplication algorithm for a matrix of some dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of important object-level takeaways from the paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The search space for various algorithms and mathematical techniques is enormous&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Existing algorithms and techniques are often not provably the most globally efficient; there is room to improve&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We can improve an algorithm by paying attention to its implementation, as well as its theoretical virtues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also teaches us some things about the meta-level, and the benefits of DeepMind’s distinctive approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DeepMind’s approach is scaleable vertically: the more time and compute they spend on a task, the more they can achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DeepMind’s approach is scaleable horizontally: the more tasks they apply their approach to, the more tasks they can achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these points suggest something important about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/Scaling-hypothesis#scaling-hypothesis&quot;&gt;scaling hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weak version of the scaling hypothesis claims that most of what we need to improve AI performance is more compute. All we need to do is scale up the computational and data resources of a sufficiently scalable model, and we’ll get much better performance. Give the right model architecture enough data, and enough compute/time, and our problem is solvable (up to the phyical limits, or something like that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I begin my argument, I’ll make a presupposition: we won’t get to AGI. My hunch is that AGI is a bit of a chimera, and that progress in AI will consist mostly in the discovery and application of specialist models for narrow-domain problem solving. Some models may generalise to some extent, some may not. But over time the progress of narrow-domain AIs will far outstrip the progress in broad-domain AIs, and the market will reallocate resources accordingly.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this presupposition, we can ask an important question: does the weak scaling hypothesis hold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world in which AI is applied to solving narrow-domain issues, AI researchers have two major tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How should they decide which tasks to work on?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How should they encode a given problem such that it is tractable for AI to solve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) is hard to decide &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, because it will depend on the path-dependence progress of science (and the supporting AI). Utility-maximising functions might be helpful here: what task has the lowest cost and the highest utility? But a lot will be baked into ‘cost’ and ‘utility’, and the various cost bases of tasks will change depending on how the technology evolves, what data is available, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, AI researchers will develop heuristics, industry and academic partnerships, new data sources, etc., and that will help narrow down the range of tasks susceptible to quick resolution. In short, AI researchers will rely on &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; and experience to guide their decisions over the medium- and long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) is more analysable from first principles. Tasks need to be encoded in such a way as to make them solvable by the model: the model architecture needs to be designed in such a way as to not preclude the task; the input needs to be readable by the model; the set of training data needs to be large and varied enough to prevent overfit, and contain sufficient signal to allow generalisation to inputs outside that dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, the game needs to be designed &lt;em&gt;such that it’s the sort of game that the model can play&lt;/em&gt;. This is what DeepMind seem especially good at: they are able to express, e.g., protein folding, or tensor decomposition, in the form of a game that their RL agent can play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ability – being able to reorganise a question in the form of a model-appropriate game – doesn’t look nearly as susceptible to Moore’s Law-style exponential speed-ups. Researchers’ insights and abilities – in other terms, researcher productivity – don’t scale exponentially.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It takes time and energy and the serendipitousness of a well-functioning research lab to cultivate them. Scaling compute down to an effective cost of zero doesn’t help if we’re not using these models to attack the right issues (1) in the right way (2). The marginal next unit of compute will exhibit diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if that’s the case, then it’s clear that &lt;em&gt;compute isn’t the bottleneck&lt;/em&gt;. The bottleneck, instead, will be humans figuring out which problems to tackle (1) and how to regiment them, encode them, and design games/reward systems to get AI to solve them (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepMind have the absolute best people on the planet working on this stuff, and it takes them time and huge amounts of resources. So we end up back at &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers need time and experience to develop taste, and the ability to apply heuristics and deep domain knowledge – something much more ineffable and difficult to scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t of course mean that there won’t be wonderful progress in many, many domains, brought about by ‘merely’ scaling the compute available. Even Kuhn is at pains to stress that ‘normal science’ is progress! But it does mean that the scaling hypothesis doesn’t necessarily scale research output at the same rate, at least not without the accompanying good taste.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is just an assumption, and one that changes the following argument significantly if it is false. A world with AGI looks, I think we can all assume, quite a bit different. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For some empirical data on this point, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/467912a&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that doubling the population of a city increases its productivity per capita by ~15%. In other words, productivity per capita scales linearly, not exponentially. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My book on product engineering with Ethereum is coming along well; I should have the first draft done in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been rewatching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80025678&quot;&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt;, partly in preparation for the new season, partly to revisit the life of Elizabeth II, and most of all because I have had several casual conversations with friends on various topics in 20th-century British political history, and I wanted a lightweight set of touch points, nudges toward various prime ministers and political events that I might read into more deeply. As a result, almost all of my reading time has been taken up with television. It’s amazing how easily that can happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did, however, manage to reread &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135&quot;&gt;Stubborn Attachments&lt;/a&gt; by Tyler Cowen. It was much less surprising and enjoyable on rereading, but I suppose that’s a sign of a book whose ideas seem to be more mainstream, whose arguments are more familiar and plausible, whose memes have sunk in to my brain. If I have any criticisms now, it’s that it isn’t ambitious or controversial enough; he caveats the demand for growth by demanding sustainable growth; he builds a broader normative pluralism into a notion of ‘Wealth+’; both of which feel more like a concession to the zeitgeist rather than a serious commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody fed the lyrics of ‘Imagine’ into an AI and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sundellviz/status/1574492250620542980&quot;&gt;asked it to write new verses.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NSN searched for people who wanted to start new schools that we intended to allow under new legislation then worked with them on their application.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It developed specific ideas for how the system should work. Unlike normal think tanks, it worked at the extreme detail end of the spectrum, like drafting actual forms that the DfE could use.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We thought that if we helped people develop specific projects and could actually bend the bureaucracy, we could get ‘Free Schools’ going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting, because it suggests a model for &lt;em&gt;state-adjacent&lt;/em&gt; institutions that support the functions of the state without being tied to the bureaucracy or subject to the incentives. Something somewhere in the midpoint between a management consultancy, a think tank, and a training institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like this sort of model is beneficial in specific circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where there is considerable state funding for a certain industry / project / goal&lt;/strong&gt;, where ‘considerable’ is relative to the industry / project / goal. (You need more money to make a new nuclear power plant design than you do a school.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where access to that funding is reasonably competitive.&lt;/strong&gt; This means it needs to be accessible to SMEs or small teams, rather than just Serco, G4S, the major universities, and the other big boys.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where the government department distributing the funding is receptive to introductions, advice, support&lt;/strong&gt;. A lot of the benefits seem to come from new ideas being introduced revisited through a feedback loop, so the department must be flexible enough to integrate the state-adjacent institution into its decision making – or, at least, leave its door open to such input. Generally, I suspect, departments are only really flexible in this sort of way during their first few years and for a year or two after a major shake-up (eg DoE under Gove).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few ideas where this could be useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An ‘ARIA Attractor’: finding individuals / teams with audacious projects, helping them refine their proposals, and using the knowledge gained from the search to help shape the department’s broader research focus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An analogous attractor for the UKRI / NIH / other ‘normal science’ funding bodies, with an emphasis on speeding up the funding application process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standards setting and guidance for navigating the planning system, but beyond a simple planning consultancy. A team of people who work hard to befriend and effectively lobby local planning teams, giving developers large and small the opportunity to boot up to the activation energy required to get anything built. It would be useful to focus on local authorities with a recent change in governance, or with an especially acute housing problem, where the demand to do something is greater.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A company to abstract away the medical licensing and compliance process and help guide new teams / University spin-offs to apply for medical licenses. Medical software, in particular, is notoriously hard to get adequate licensing for. A team dedicated to building solutions and increasing governmental awareness of these issues, working with funding bodies and NHS clinical commissioning groups, could meaningfully move the needle on what innovation we permit in the medical space (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarletcomply.com&quot;&gt;Scarlet&lt;/a&gt; are doing interesting things adjacent to this idea.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating and supporting these sorts of state-adjacent institutions could be an important &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pfbLKnJmDKYSPPCEW/four-focus-areas-of-effective-altruism&quot;&gt;focus area&lt;/a&gt; for a movement like Effective Altruism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it could also be a powerful new framing for start-ups themselves: many of these ideas could grow into profitable businesses as well as institutions with positive-sum state/business interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking the question “how can the private or non-profit sector smooth over the relationship between the state and others?” is a subtly different question – and one with (in many cases perhaps) more leverage than the simpler question “how can the state do things more effectively?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because it refocuses the conversation on what can be done &lt;em&gt;practically&lt;/em&gt;, today, without needing large-scale systemic reform, without needing to push through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dominiccummings.com/tag/procurement/&quot;&gt;ossified systems of government purchasing&lt;/a&gt; and permits that sit in deeply suboptimal equilibria.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="politics" /><category term="housing" /><category term="startups" /><summary type="html">From Dominic Cummings’s recent ‘Snippets 5’:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Links, July 2022</title><link href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/03/links-july-2022.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Links, July 2022" /><published>2022-08-03T11:35:28+01:00</published><updated>2022-08-03T11:35:28+01:00</updated><id>https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/03/links-july-2022</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/03/links-july-2022.html">&lt;p&gt;ETHCC Paris, The Idler Festival, dinners at the Liberal Club, work on the book, actual work, and learning to fly; it’s been a busy month in which I deadlifted 100kg for the first time, only read a couple of books, submitted the first few chapters of &lt;strong&gt;Products, Protocols, and Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;, and have found myself exhausted. I am more energised when I am productive, and more productive when I am energised, so ascertaining how to bootstrap myself into either productivity or energy is I think a high-leverage activity with which I’ll be experimenting for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important thing I read this month was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eichmann-Jerusalem-Report-Banality-Evil/dp/024155229X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Eichmann in Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t quite realise how much of a journalist Arendt was, and look forward to reading more of her political theory in the future. It’s rare, nowadays, to go from in-the-trenches journalism to academic theorising. (Counterexamples: Gramsci, sort of? Maybe Robert Caro? Anne Applebaum, perhaps?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also supplemented Arendt with Richard Evans’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Third-Reich-Power-1933-Hearts/dp/0141009764&quot;&gt;Third Reich in Power&lt;/a&gt;, the second volume in the series. I read the first volume maybe a decade ago and enjoyed it. The second was more of a slog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hard-Drive-Making-Microsoft-Empire/dp/0887306292/ref=sr_1_1?crid=D7B2ZBP7Q351&amp;amp;keywords=hard+drive+bill+gates&amp;amp;qid=1659523562&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=hard+drive+bi%2Cstripbooks%2C798&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Hard Drive&lt;/a&gt;, a book about Bill Gates and the early days of Microsoft. Gates was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more competitive and ruthless than I thought – and I thought he was pretty competitive and ruthless!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154&quot;&gt;All Out War&lt;/a&gt; by Tim Shipman. Fantastic political journalism, no agenda, just the steady beat and the sporadic bursts of a battle unfolding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good post from Tanner &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholars-stage.org/the-fall-of-history-as-a-major-and-as-a-part-of-the-humanities/&quot;&gt;on the decline of history majors&lt;/a&gt; and the relationship between the sciences and the humanities. Also a very well-written letter &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/criq.12675&quot;&gt;on decolonising the curriculum&lt;/a&gt; and the contradictions inherent in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something very distinctive about the ‘long-form interviews with macho men for a predominantly working-to-lower-middle-class white male audience that leans right’ format, and I can’t quite put my finger on what it is. It’s far from anti-intellectualism: the hosts and their guests are smart and eager to grapple with complicated ideas. It’s not quite one-sidedness, because they can surprised you. It’s almost an aesthetic property, a flavour of self-assuredness, the eschewing of the effete. Whatever it is, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwK_XLFOm_I&quot;&gt;this interview with Erik Prince&lt;/a&gt; was swimming in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonderful lecture &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n068fel-W9I&quot;&gt;on the F-22 Raptor and the engineering decisions behind it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brie Wolfson wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://every.to/p/what-i-miss-about-working-at-stripe&quot;&gt;on the work culture early-days Stripe&lt;/a&gt;. A reminder that hard work is a feature, not a bug – and the symptom of a thriving culture, not the cause of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordinary citizens have &lt;a href=&quot;https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2016/01/american-and-chinese-oligarchies.html&quot;&gt;essentially no influence over government in the United States&lt;/a&gt;. What the elites want, they generally get. It’s amazing that US society is generally so stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, not much writing, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/06/27/wallets-as-identity.html&quot;&gt;Wallets As Identity&lt;/a&gt;, a rough first draft of a chapter from the Ethereum book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began five books but only finished one: Feyerabend’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Against-Method-Paul-K-Feyerabend/dp/1844674428&quot;&gt;Against Method&lt;/a&gt;. I intend to write in more detail about it, because it was both very good and also rather illegible. After some effort, I think I have a clear idea of what he is trying to do, but I can’t see how his arguments don’t collapse into a much broader scepticism. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamieRumbelow/status/1535955057966989313&quot;&gt;Here’s a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; with some quotes I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unabridged edition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/A-History-of-Britain-Volume-1-Audiobook/B0094OI6U4&quot;&gt;Simon Schama’s History of Great Britain series&lt;/a&gt; is wonderful – Schama writes so well – and it’s currently included with any Audible subscription, although that will change this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sriramk.com/memos.html&quot;&gt;A collection of memos&lt;/a&gt; ‘written for an internal audience’, mostly business and technology but some politics too. Diaries and letters and other documentary on how the sausage gets made gives you a good sense for 1. the trade-offs involved in absolutely everything, something that is easy to consider intellectually and much harder to feel intuitively, 2. how chaotic and unregimentable progress is a priori, and 3. the sheer variability of approaches and styles of success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Nielsen writes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/&quot;&gt;effective altruism&lt;/a&gt; and his take on its problems providing a moral core for an individual’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1FPKMooGfbOGzESM1G2ffC?si=e2cb4c6bb8d6440b&amp;amp;nd=1&quot;&gt;this Dylan B-side&lt;/a&gt;, from the Blood on the Tracks sessions. Lovely and sad and detached. Dylan’s narrator is always at arm’s length from his subject, even when he’s singing about himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two useful reviews of The Future of Fusion Energy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://martin.kleppmann.com/2022/01/03/future-of-fusion-energy.html&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; from Martin Kleppman, &lt;a href=&quot;https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-future-of-fusion&quot;&gt;the other&lt;/a&gt; from the Astral Codex Ten book review contest: the former reviews the book, the latter reviews its content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toby Ord on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2104/2104.01191.pdf&quot;&gt;the knowability of the Edges of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;; and a fun lecture from Stuart Armstrong on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQTfuI-9jIo&quot;&gt;how we might get there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
