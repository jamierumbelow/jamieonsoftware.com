&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Project-Hail-Mary-Andy-Weir/dp/0593135202&quot;&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/a&gt; was fun, although I think it tried to be too smart – the science was a little too complicated in a way that felt unbelievable – which made it a poorer book than the Martian. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X&quot;&gt;The Man Who Solved The Market&lt;/a&gt; was just interesting enough to get me through a four-hour flight.&lt;/p&gt;

Some minor edits to do and then to production. Other than that, I’ve been enjoying drinking again – more on that soon – and reading, relaxing, resting. I’m taking the rest of the year off to plan and scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavy fiction month. The Rest is History &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-history-podcast/185-agatha-christie&quot;&gt;prompted me&lt;/a&gt; to start reading some Agatha Cristie, so I sat down over the weekend and read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Then-There-Were-None-Favourite/dp/0008123209&quot;&gt;And Then There Were None&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murder-Roger-Ackroyd-Poirot/dp/0007527527&quot;&gt;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleeping-Murder-Marple-Agatha-Christie/dp/000819663X&quot;&gt;Sleeping Murder&lt;/a&gt;. The writing is charming and lovely, and funny, even when grim. You truly get the sense that she’s building these tropes as she goes along, that the structure of the whodunnit genre was falling out of her pen as she went. Totally gripping. I’ve not enjoyed fiction this effortlessly since Station Eleven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Mars-Kim-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0007310161&quot;&gt;Red Mars&lt;/a&gt; by Kim Stanley Robinson, a good novel but about 200 pages longer than it needed to be. I find the same problem with most scifi and fantasy. Something about world-building lends itself to self-indulgence? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reread David Yaffe’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Reckless-Daughter-Portrait-Joni-Mitchell/dp/0374538069&quot;&gt;Reckless Daughter&lt;/a&gt; in preperation for my Joni Mitchell Interintellect salon, which went well. I put that book down liking her much less as a person and much more as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.explainpaper.com&quot;&gt;Upload a paper, highlight confusing text, get an explanation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting approach to price iteration and programmable pricing structures: &lt;a href=&quot;https://priceops.org&quot;&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tier.run&quot;&gt;practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good housing stuff this month too. Much more energy toward this issue in my little corner of the internet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MrSteveDriscoll/status/1587249795428589568&quot;&gt;Auckland upzoning reforms working well&lt;/a&gt;, causing &lt;a href=&quot;https://onefinaleffort.com/auckland&quot;&gt;a meaningful decrease in real rents and an increase in affordability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(One answer is, &lt;a href=&quot;https://samdumitriu.substack.com/p/why-britain-struggles-to-build-infrastructure&quot;&gt;of course&lt;/a&gt;, NIMBYism, but the question is deeper and the answer more cultural than that.)&lt;/p&gt;

Decided to restructure it all halfway through the first draft, which has meant a lot of rewriting. I’m learning a lot about how to sustain an argument over ~300 pages, and what makes for clear, technical exposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed to dash out something small on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/10/09/alphatensor-scaling.html&quot;&gt;AlphaTensor and research taste&lt;/a&gt;. Since I noticed this taste dynamic, it keeps popping up everywhere. It’s certainly not a new insight, but it’s something I see addressed an unfortunately small amount in the philosophy of science literature. The scientist is taken as some a priori given to most philosophical models of science, which, if my observation is correct, is skipping over perhaps the most important part of the analysis. Feyerabend gestures towards it in Against Method, but, again, doesn’t quite get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been reading a lot. Winston Churchill’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Early-Life-Winston-Churchill/dp/0907871623&quot;&gt;My Early Life&lt;/a&gt; was a delightful, charming piece of Kipling-hued imperialism. His world-view is so remote from ours, so free of moral ambiguity. It’s a decidedly Victorian book, of heroes and adventures, a sort of anti-Le Carré. He is a wonderful writer and a gifted storyteller. Well worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Petzold’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319&quot;&gt;Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software&lt;/a&gt; was also extremely good. He builds up an intuitive model for digital computing, from the very basics of Morse code via flashlights to complex microprocessors. This was a fill-in-the-gaps book for me, something I could read quickly – I finished it in two days – but has meaningfully added to my basic understanding. I didn’t, for instance, have a clear idea of a CPU’s clock cycle, which this book has changed superlatively. It was funny, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just finished Simon Morden’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Planet-Natural-History-Mars/dp/1783966610/&quot;&gt;The Red Planet: A Natural History of Mars&lt;/a&gt;, which I’m reading in a cluster with some other Mars books. More top spacey content! Good passages on competing theories of crust formation and covers the basics of the protoplanetary disc super well. Makes me want to write something similar on Saturn (an infinitely more mysterious and beautiful planet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cosmos-Cosmic-Evolution-Science-Civilisation/dp/0349107033&quot;&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt; by Carl Sagan. It has taken me 27 years to read a book that I should have read in my early teens. I felt a flickering rememberance of days past, that wide-eyed, ambitious, weird young boy, trying to understand who he was and why he was so unhappy. If I had read this book then, I suspect I’d be a scientist now – and would have become much more content with my weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first Interintellect Salon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://interintellect.com/salon/freedom-and-love-in-the-music-of-joni-mitchell/&quot;&gt;Freedom and Love in the Music of Joni Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; is later this month. Should be wonderfully self-indulgent and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-concrete-vision-of-the-liberal&quot;&gt;A concrete vision of the liberal democratic future&lt;/a&gt; from Noah Smith, and a more pointed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scarcity-crisis-college-housing-health-care/621221/&quot;&gt;piece on the abundance agenda&lt;/a&gt;. This quote from Noah stuck with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The final thing that the liberal democratic vision needs is a way to accommodate conservatives. The divisions within the democratic world are the primary reason why the autocratic powers are able to make their case at all. But a great many people within any society, including liberal democratic ones, are socially conservative to a greater or lesser degree. If the vision of the future that liberal democracies present is one where conservative values have been wiped from the Earth, then conservatives will feel they have no choice but to embrace reactionary illiberalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also from Noah, &lt;a href=&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-per-capita-emissions-is-a-bad&quot;&gt;why per-capita emissions is a bad framing for the carbon debate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of anti-EA discourse began in our little corner of the Internet this month. Liam Kofi Bright made a fair point that the evaluative standards of the movement’s critics seem &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lastpositivist/status/1578695082748055553&quot;&gt;radically out-of-whack&lt;/a&gt;. David Shor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidshor/status/1578779382545530886&quot;&gt;gave a good reply&lt;/a&gt; about the psychology of the median EA member (via Nadia). And Nathan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/effective-altruism#An_attempt_at_a_minimal_set_of_effective_altruism_axioms&quot;&gt;put together an attempt at a minimal set of EA axioms&lt;/a&gt; that is worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really enjoying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pedestrianobservations.com&quot;&gt;Pedestrian Observations&lt;/a&gt; blog, another good example (along with Construction Physics) of the single-issue blog that &lt;a href=&quot;https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/&quot;&gt;Patrick and Tyler discussed&lt;/a&gt; back in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;COLLISON: What kinds of blogs should there be more of in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;COWEN: Single-issue blogs on issues of importance. If you take something like penal reform, an underrated cause. Prisons, I think, are barbaric, but it’s not an easy problem to solve. There’s not a quick fix. Some people do need to be constrained in some way. The idea that there should be more blogs that track that and persistently deliver the message, “Something is wrong here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jamierumbelow/status/1587785290994929665&quot;&gt;your single-issue blog ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Using hedonic methods I find that wind projects can impose significant external local costs, while solar projects do not. I then show that planning officials are particularly sensitive to local costs in their area. The resulting misallocation of investment may have increased wind power deployment costs by 10-29%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their approach is a variant of the deep reinforcement-learning-guided Monte Carlo tree search that they have applied so successfully to playing Chess and Go. What they have done, very effectively, is to design a game with the objective of finding the most efficient tensor multiplication algorithm for a matrix of some dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of important object-level takeaways from the paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The search space for various algorithms and mathematical techniques is enormous&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Existing algorithms and techniques are often not provably the most globally efficient; there is room to improve&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We can improve an algorithm by paying attention to its implementation, as well as its theoretical virtues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also teaches us some things about the meta-level, and the benefits of DeepMind’s distinctive approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DeepMind’s approach is scaleable vertically: the more time and compute they spend on a task, the more they can achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DeepMind’s approach is scaleable horizontally: the more tasks they apply their approach to, the more tasks they can achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these points suggest something important about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/Scaling-hypothesis#scaling-hypothesis&quot;&gt;scaling hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weak version of the scaling hypothesis claims that most of what we need to improve AI performance is more compute. All we need to do is scale up the computational and data resources of a sufficiently scalable model, and we’ll get much better performance. Give the right model architecture enough data, and enough compute/time, and our problem is solvable (up to the phyical limits, or something like that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I begin my argument, I’ll make a presupposition: we won’t get to AGI. My hunch is that AGI is a bit of a chimera, and that progress in AI will consist mostly in the discovery and application of specialist models for narrow-domain problem solving. Some models may generalise to some extent, some may not. But over time the progress of narrow-domain AIs will far outstrip the progress in broad-domain AIs, and the market will reallocate resources accordingly.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this presupposition, we can ask an important question: does the weak scaling hypothesis hold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world in which AI is applied to solving narrow-domain issues, AI researchers have two major tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How should they decide which tasks to work on?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How should they encode a given problem such that it is tractable for AI to solve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) is hard to decide &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, because it will depend on the path-dependence progress of science (and the supporting AI). Utility-maximising functions might be helpful here: what task has the lowest cost and the highest utility? But a lot will be baked into ‘cost’ and ‘utility’, and the various cost bases of tasks will change depending on how the technology evolves, what data is available, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, AI researchers will develop heuristics, industry and academic partnerships, new data sources, etc., and that will help narrow down the range of tasks susceptible to quick resolution. In short, AI researchers will rely on &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; and experience to guide their decisions over the medium- and long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) is more analysable from first principles. Tasks need to be encoded in such a way as to make them solvable by the model: the model architecture needs to be designed in such a way as to not preclude the task; the input needs to be readable by the model; the set of training data needs to be large and varied enough to prevent overfit, and contain sufficient signal to allow generalisation to inputs outside that dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, the game needs to be designed &lt;em&gt;such that it’s the sort of game that the model can play&lt;/em&gt;. This is what DeepMind seem especially good at: they are able to express, e.g., protein folding, or tensor decomposition, in the form of a game that their RL agent can play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ability – being able to reorganise a question in the form of a model-appropriate game – doesn’t look nearly as susceptible to Moore’s Law-style exponential speed-ups. Researchers’ insights and abilities – in other terms, researcher productivity – don’t scale exponentially.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It takes time and energy and the serendipitousness of a well-functioning research lab to cultivate them. Scaling compute down to an effective cost of zero doesn’t help if we’re not using these models to attack the right issues (1) in the right way (2). The marginal next unit of compute will exhibit diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if that’s the case, then it’s clear that &lt;em&gt;compute isn’t the bottleneck&lt;/em&gt;. The bottleneck, instead, will be humans figuring out which problems to tackle (1) and how to regiment them, encode them, and design games/reward systems to get AI to solve them (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepMind have the absolute best people on the planet working on this stuff, and it takes them time and huge amounts of resources. So we end up back at &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers need time and experience to develop taste, and the ability to apply heuristics and deep domain knowledge – something much more ineffable and difficult to scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t of course mean that there won’t be wonderful progress in many, many domains, brought about by ‘merely’ scaling the compute available. Even Kuhn is at pains to stress that ‘normal science’ is progress! But it does mean that the scaling hypothesis doesn’t necessarily scale research output at the same rate, at least not without the accompanying good taste.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This is just an assumption, and one that changes the following argument significantly if it is false. A world with AGI looks, I think we can all assume, quite a bit different. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For some empirical data on this point, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/467912a&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that doubling the population of a city increases its productivity per capita by ~15%. In other words, productivity per capita scales linearly, not exponentially. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My book on product engineering with Ethereum is coming along well; I should have the first draft done in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been rewatching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80025678&quot;&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt;, partly in preparation for the new season, partly to revisit the life of Elizabeth II, and most of all because I have had several casual conversations with friends on various topics in 20th-century British political history, and I wanted a lightweight set of touch points, nudges toward various prime ministers and political events that I might read into more deeply. As a result, almost all of my reading time has been taken up with television. It’s amazing how easily that can happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did, however, manage to reread &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135&quot;&gt;Stubborn Attachments&lt;/a&gt; by Tyler Cowen. It was much less surprising and enjoyable on rereading, but I suppose that’s a sign of a book whose ideas seem to be more mainstream, whose arguments are more familiar and plausible, whose memes have sunk in to my brain. If I have any criticisms now, it’s that it isn’t ambitious or controversial enough; he caveats the demand for growth by demanding sustainable growth; he builds a broader normative pluralism into a notion of ‘Wealth+’; both of which feel more like a concession to the zeitgeist rather than a serious commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody fed the lyrics of ‘Imagine’ into an AI and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sundellviz/status/1574492250620542980&quot;&gt;asked it to write new verses.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NSN searched for people who wanted to start new schools that we intended to allow under new legislation then worked with them on their application.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It developed specific ideas for how the system should work. Unlike normal think tanks, it worked at the extreme detail end of the spectrum, like drafting actual forms that the DfE could use.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We thought that if we helped people develop specific projects and could actually bend the bureaucracy, we could get ‘Free Schools’ going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting, because it suggests a model for &lt;em&gt;state-adjacent&lt;/em&gt; institutions that support the functions of the state without being tied to the bureaucracy or subject to the incentives. Something somewhere in the midpoint between a management consultancy, a think tank, and a training institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like this sort of model is beneficial in specific circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where there is considerable state funding for a certain industry / project / goal&lt;/strong&gt;, where ‘considerable’ is relative to the industry / project / goal. (You need more money to make a new nuclear power plant design than you do a school.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where access to that funding is reasonably competitive.&lt;/strong&gt; This means it needs to be accessible to SMEs or small teams, rather than just Serco, G4S, the major universities, and the other big boys.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where the government department distributing the funding is receptive to introductions, advice, support&lt;/strong&gt;. A lot of the benefits seem to come from new ideas being introduced revisited through a feedback loop, so the department must be flexible enough to integrate the state-adjacent institution into its decision making – or, at least, leave its door open to such input. Generally, I suspect, departments are only really flexible in this sort of way during their first few years and for a year or two after a major shake-up (eg DoE under Gove).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few ideas where this could be useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An ‘ARIA Attractor’: finding individuals / teams with audacious projects, helping them refine their proposals, and using the knowledge gained from the search to help shape the department’s broader research focus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An analogous attractor for the UKRI / NIH / other ‘normal science’ funding bodies, with an emphasis on speeding up the funding application process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standards setting and guidance for navigating the planning system, but beyond a simple planning consultancy. A team of people who work hard to befriend and effectively lobby local planning teams, giving developers large and small the opportunity to boot up to the activation energy required to get anything built. It would be useful to focus on local authorities with a recent change in governance, or with an especially acute housing problem, where the demand to do something is greater.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A company to abstract away the medical licensing and compliance process and help guide new teams / University spin-offs to apply for medical licenses. Medical software, in particular, is notoriously hard to get adequate licensing for. A team dedicated to building solutions and increasing governmental awareness of these issues, working with funding bodies and NHS clinical commissioning groups, could meaningfully move the needle on what innovation we permit in the medical space (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarletcomply.com&quot;&gt;Scarlet&lt;/a&gt; are doing interesting things adjacent to this idea.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating and supporting these sorts of state-adjacent institutions could be an important &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pfbLKnJmDKYSPPCEW/four-focus-areas-of-effective-altruism&quot;&gt;focus area&lt;/a&gt; for a movement like Effective Altruism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it could also be a powerful new framing for start-ups themselves: many of these ideas could grow into profitable businesses as well as institutions with positive-sum state/business interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking the question “how can the private or non-profit sector smooth over the relationship between the state and others?” is a subtly different question – and one with (in many cases perhaps) more leverage than the simpler question “how can the state do things more effectively?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because it refocuses the conversation on what can be done &lt;em&gt;practically&lt;/em&gt;, today, without needing large-scale systemic reform, without needing to push through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dominiccummings.com/tag/procurement/&quot;&gt;ossified systems of government purchasing&lt;/a&gt; and permits that sit in deeply suboptimal equilibria.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="politics" /><category term="housing" /><category term="startups" /><summary type="html">From Dominic Cummings’s recent ‘Snippets 5’:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Links, July 2022</title><link href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/03/links-july-2022.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Links, July 2022" /><published>2022-08-03T11:35:28+01:00</published><updated>2022-08-03T11:35:28+01:00</updated><id>https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/03/links-july-2022</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/03/links-july-2022.html">&lt;p&gt;ETHCC Paris, The Idler Festival, dinners at the Liberal Club, work on the book, actual work, and learning to fly; it’s been a busy month in which I deadlifted 100kg for the first time, only read a couple of books, submitted the first few chapters of &lt;strong&gt;Products, Protocols, and Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;, and have found myself exhausted.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important thing I read this month was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eichmann-Jerusalem-Report-Banality-Evil/dp/024155229X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Eichmann in Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t quite realise how much of a journalist Arendt was, and look forward to reading more of her political theory in the future. It’s rare, nowadays, to go from in-the-trenches journalism to academic theorising. (Counterexamples: Gramsci, sort of? Maybe Robert Caro? Anne Applebaum, perhaps?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also supplemented Arendt with Richard Evans’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Third-Reich-Power-1933-Hearts/dp/0141009764&quot;&gt;Third Reich in Power&lt;/a&gt;, the second volume in the series. I read the first volume maybe a decade ago and enjoyed it. The second was more of a slog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hard-Drive-Making-Microsoft-Empire/dp/0887306292/ref=sr_1_1?crid=D7B2ZBP7Q351&amp;amp;keywords=hard+drive+bill+gates&amp;amp;qid=1659523562&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=hard+drive+bi%2Cstripbooks%2C798&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Hard Drive&lt;/a&gt;, a book about Bill Gates and the early days of Microsoft. Gates was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more competitive and ruthless than I thought – and I thought he was pretty competitive and ruthless!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154&quot;&gt;All Out War&lt;/a&gt; by Tim Shipman. Fantastic political journalism, no agenda, just the steady beat and the sporadic bursts of a battle unfolding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good post from Tanner &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholars-stage.org/the-fall-of-history-as-a-major-and-as-a-part-of-the-humanities/&quot;&gt;on the decline of history majors&lt;/a&gt; and the relationship between the sciences and the humanities.

&lt;p&gt;There’s something very distinctive about the ‘long-form interviews with macho men for a predominantly working-to-lower-middle-class white male audience that leans right’ format, and I can’t quite put my finger on what it is. It’s far from anti-intellectualism: the hosts and their guests are smart and eager to grapple with complicated ideas. It’s not quite one-sidedness, because they can surprised you. It’s almost an aesthetic property, a flavour of self-assuredness, the eschewing of the effete. Whatever it is, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwK_XLFOm_I&quot;&gt;this interview with Erik Prince&lt;/a&gt; was swimming in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, not much writing, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/06/27/wallets-as-identity.html&quot;&gt;Wallets As Identity&lt;/a&gt;, a rough first draft of a chapter from the Ethereum book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began five books but only finished one: Feyerabend’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Against-Method-Paul-K-Feyerabend/dp/1844674428&quot;&gt;Against Method&lt;/a&gt;. I intend to write in more detail about it, because it was both very good and also rather illegible. After some effort, I think I have a clear idea of what he is trying to do, but I can’t see how his arguments don’t collapse into a much broader scepticism. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamieRumbelow/status/1535955057966989313&quot;&gt;Here’s a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; with some quotes I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unabridged edition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/A-History-of-Britain-Volume-1-Audiobook/B0094OI6U4&quot;&gt;Simon Schama’s History of Great Britain series&lt;/a&gt; is wonderful – Schama writes so well – and it’s currently included with any Audible subscription, although that will change this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sriramk.com/memos.html&quot;&gt;A collection of memos&lt;/a&gt; ‘written for an internal audience’, mostly business and technology but some politics too. Diaries and letters and other documentary on how the sausage gets made gives you a good sense for 1. the trade-offs involved in absolutely everything, something that is easy to consider intellectually and much harder to feel intuitively, 2. how chaotic and unregimentable progress is a priori, and 3. the sheer variability of approaches and styles of success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Nielsen writes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/&quot;&gt;effective altruism&lt;/a&gt; and his take on its problems providing a moral core for an individual’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

Any and all feedback welcome!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologists use metaphors to make &lt;strong&gt;skeuomorphic links&lt;/strong&gt;, bridging old paradigms to new. The ‘desktop’ and ‘trash can’ and even the keyboard is a form of skeuomorphic link, giving users of a new platform enough conceptual and aesthetic resources to make sense of it, to feel familiar, connected to it. Computers and interfaces are physical, and rely on all the same instinctual responses, the same clusters of predispositions and responses attached to entities in the physical world. So new technologies can co-opt these instincts by creating these skeuomorphic links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most common example of skueomorphich linkage in crypto is the metaphor of the ‘wallet’. This post argues that it is one of the most misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick diversion on the structure of metaphors: metaphors behave by implying certain things about the subject based on the object. Good metaphors are good when the subject does indeed resemble the object in those ways. Good metaphors also have the nice property of illuminating the subject of the metaphor in ways that the reader doesn’t expect. A good metaphor can help reveal the shapes and contours of the subject by making us consider the subject from a new angle. ‘All the world’s a stage’, Jacques soliliquises in &lt;strong&gt;As You Like It&lt;/strong&gt;, and the entrances and exits and performance that this equivalence conjures up help illuminate the human condition, revealing it to be a form of entrapment, confinement to a pre-determined script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, then, does the metaphor of ‘wallet’ imply? It suggests a few features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A wallet holds things&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A wallet holds a specific sort of thing, namely financial things (such as credit cards and cash)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A wallet is a physical item, and plays the various roles that physical items do, such as signalling style, wealth, and status&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto wallets – what we’ll call ‘accounts’ from now on to avoid confusion – have none of these features. Accounts don’t hold things: accounts represent identity. Accounts aren’t limited to interacting with financial products: they interact with anything representable on the blockchain. Accounts, of course, aren’t physical items: they are an abstraction over an individual on a ledger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth stopping at this point and asking why any of this matters. Isn’t it just a shallow, semantic dispute? No. Because as well as being illuminating about the subject, a metaphor can often &lt;strong&gt;constrain&lt;/strong&gt; our understanding of the subject, especially if it becomes the primary mechanism through which the subject is known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has happened with the wallet metaphor in crypto, which is why I believe it’s especially important to pay attention to what wallets actually are, how the metaphor shapes our thinking, and how it limits our thinking too. All the world is a stage, maybe, but if it is we still have plenty of freedom to improvise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accounts-dont-hold-things&quot;&gt;Accounts don’t hold things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An account is a pair of public and private keys. A private key is used to generate a public key, and the public key is used to generate an address. So when you see account addresses such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045&lt;/code&gt; (one of Vitalik’s accounts), what you’re really seeing is the result of passing Vitalik’s private key through the set of cryptographic functions that produce these addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of how this works are interesting, but out of the scope of this post. All we need to know for now is that this process is &lt;strong&gt;deterministic&lt;/strong&gt;, in the sense that it returns the same value for the same input, no matter how often you run it, and &lt;strong&gt;irreversible&lt;/strong&gt;, in the sense that it’s very very hard to get the private key from the wallet address.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you know the private key then you can generate the public key, but you can’t (easily) go in the other direction. This is one of the reasons why it’s so important to keep your private key private: your private key is the one piece of information somebody needs to get access to your account. Fortunately, most users don’t have to worry about the content of the private key at all: they can use wallet software that holds the private key in a secure way. For product engineers, you’ll always need to keep in mind that the private key is sacred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this link to the wallet metaphor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I lied a little: accounts do ‘hold’ something. They hold ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. But this is by communal assent: a group of people, incentivised to follow the same set of rules, collectively agree that a certain amount of ether is owned by a specific account, and another amount of ether is owned by a different account. It’s the collective assent that underwrites the ownership claim, not the account itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got cash in your wallet, you actually do have cash in your wallet. A portion of the ‘state’ of the money-system is in your pocket. If you’ve got ether in your account, you’ve got a claim on the group for the amount of that ether. It’s a guarantee, secured by cryptography and incentives, that when you decide you want to do something with that ether we’ll all agree that you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m also telling the truth: accounts don’t really hold that much at all, and the notion of ‘holding’ your ether and your tokens is a euphemism. Your account is the mechanism of a record of ownership. The state is not in your pocket, it’s ‘over there’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem a little opaque, so let’s consider some code. One of the clearest examples of how accounts don’t actually hold anything is the ERC-20 token standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This standard is the core primitive in DeFi, the basic lego brick upon which we build this cathedral. It offers a consistent interface for smart contracts that behave as a record of ledger. Contracts have to choose to implement it – that’s why it’s a standard, not a rule – but those that do share the same methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can distil the essence of ERC-20 down to only two function signatures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The actual standard contains more than these two methods, but the rest are for convenience, expedience, and extensions to the functionality, rather than being central to the model of how tokens are represented by contracts that implement it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two functions tell us everything we need to know about a piece of state. What is that piece of state? It’s a mapping from address to the number of tokens owned by that address:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mapping(address =&amp;gt; uint256) public balanceOf;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;balanceOf&lt;/code&gt; is a map – otherwise known as a dictionary, or an associative array – from an owner to the total amount owned. The total amount owned of what? The token that the contract represents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to find out how much of the token we own, we call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;balanceOf&lt;/code&gt;, passing our address. If we want to send our tokens to somebody else, we call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;transferFrom&lt;/code&gt;, passing our address, the recipient’s address, and the amount we wish to send. The token contract does the work in updating the list it holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about this carefully: &lt;strong&gt;a token is just a list of who owns the token&lt;/strong&gt;, plus a bit of metadata (such as the token’s name and symbol).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your account doesn’t ‘hold’ anything. It doesn’t know anything about the token, per se. It just gives you a way of identifying yourself as the owner of some amount of the token. And a token is just a piece of code that understands how to update this &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;balanceOf&lt;/code&gt; map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple and powerful idea, because the token contract is able to stipulate its own rules and policies around who can transfer, who can be transferred, and what the balance is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could stipulate that only a specific whitelist of addresses should be able to receive the token, for instance, restricting ownership of the token to a known set of individuals. You could exclude certain addresses. You could require a certain amount of ether in exchange for the token, or even a certain amount of another token in exchange for the token. You could even &lt;strong&gt;change the amount transferred when somebody transfers it&lt;/strong&gt;, deducting a fee. In other words, you can implement a monetary policy, controlling how the token enters the market, how it leaves it, and how it flows around between participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accounts-arent-limited&quot;&gt;Accounts aren’t limited&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the token contract is the mechanism for recording who owns what, and stipulating the rules that govern that ownership, your account isn’t limited to holding financial instruments like cash or credit cards. Tokens can be used to represent basically anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tokens represent non-fungible assets, things that can’t be exchanged for another asset just like it. You will have heard of NFTs, and NFTs are token contracts much like the ERC-20 contract we just discussed. The biggest difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 – the basic standard for representing NFTs – is that the parameters of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;transferFrom&lt;/code&gt; function are slightly different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id) public virtual;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ERC-721 contract introduces the notion of an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, and requires that the pair &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(owner, id)&lt;/code&gt; is globally unique. So a specific token – that described by the contract and the specific ID the contract defines – is owned by one and only one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NFTs are often used for digital art or collectibles, but they can be used to represent ownership of lots more. In time, they may be used to represent ownership of real-world assets: houses, cars, paintings, bottles of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NFTs can also be used for interesting, crypto-native use cases: Uniswap v3, for instance, mints an NFT that represents a deposit to a specific pool within a specific price range. Each deposit has its own custom configuration, and so the pool mints an NFT that represents your specific deposit with your specific settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fungible tokens, too, can be used to represent many more types of things than just those that map to financial value. They can represent governance rights, as they do with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TRIBE&lt;/code&gt; token, which grants the right to vote on proposals of the Tribe DAO. (At the time of writing, most governance tokens grant voting rights on a quantity basis: if you have more tokens, your vote represents more of the. But this isn’t the only model for governance design made possible by the ERC-20 token standard). They can also represent other sorts of values, such as carbon credits, or reputation, or points accumulated in a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that the ‘wallet’ metaphor suggests a constraint on the sorts of things that can be ‘held’. Since accounts don’t ‘hold’ things, the design space for what sorts of ownership and participation claims they can represent is much, much bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accounts-arent-physical-items&quot;&gt;Accounts aren’t physical items&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem like a silly point to make, but the fact that accounts aren’t physical items runs a little deeper than the obvious. Accounts aren’t physical items: they are abstractions over an individual, a face you can show to the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this means that your accounts aren’t tied to one place. If you know your private key, you can use your account in whatever interface you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;strong&gt;different interfaces can display different aspects of the same account&lt;/strong&gt;. Some interfaces – CHECK: such as what? – put an emphasis on NFT collectibles, a kind of gallery. Others might focus on the purely financial aspects of the account, its deposits and loans and investments. Perhaps an interface could be built around governance, showing the proposals and votes and engagements with protocols. Perhaps another could be built around whatever gaming tokens the account has claims to. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start to consider these sorts of product implications of the fact that accounts aren’t physical items, it makes you realise that the design space for account interfaces is co-extensive – overlapping with – the design space for tokens themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also pushes the sorts of signalling properties we mentioned earlier elsewhere. Perhaps people do signal with their &lt;strong&gt;wallet software&lt;/strong&gt; – i.e. their account interfaces – a little, using a newer or more feature-complete piece of software to indicate the sort of user they are, the sorts of things they are interested in. But the account itself is a very lightweight thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because it’s lightweight, it can be transported, as we’ve discussed. It can also be ‘hosted’ on-chain, which opens up the possibility of smart contract wallets and multi-signature wallets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accounts-are-identity&quot;&gt;Accounts are identity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is an account, then, if not a wallet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer: an account is an &lt;strong&gt;identity&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a way of informing other participants that you are who you say you are. It is a username and password. It is a mechanism to authenticate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If accounts are identity, then it means you can separate out your identities depending on different contexts of usage. You might use an account to trade, another account to represent your investments, a third to hold your claims to any artwork or collectibles. You might use accounts for different platforms with different risk profiles, or with different privacy considerations. You can separate out your identities in whatever way you choose, isolating your public, on-chain behaviour into different categories. The ownership of a private key gives you full control over what aspect of yourself you wish to show to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Products built on Ethereum need to understand this multiplicity of identities, and implement support for it in a deep way. We’ll see how this works more concretely in other posts. But for now, consider that &lt;strong&gt;your identity goes with you wherever you take it&lt;/strong&gt;. And where your identity goes, so do your claims of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, combined with the standardisation of interfaces such as ERC-20 and ERC-721, increases the power of the interfaces we can build substantially. To take a simple example: a tool for listing whatever ERC-20-compatible tokens are ‘held’ by an account will work with &lt;strong&gt;any token that meets the requirements of that interface&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s as if PayPal could support all currencies from day one, with no extra development work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wallet metaphor is generally broken, then, and can severely constrain your imagination vis-a-vis what accounts are capable of. For sure, there are ways in which an account can seem like a wallet: when you lose your account, just like your wallet, you lose the money in it; to that extent, the metaphor is true. But it’s true for different reasons. If you lose a physical wallet you’ve actually lost the cash inside it. If you lose a crypto wallet, you’ve lost your ability to prove you are the person who owns the cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are likely to continue using the term ‘wallet’, since that’s what the community uses, and there’s not much marginal benefit in changing this sort of heavily-entrenched meme. I use ‘wallet’ and ‘account’ interchangeably. But I hope this chapter has given you a sense of how accounts actually work, and why the design space for them is an awful lot bigger than a piece of folded leather that you keep in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;How hard? There’s no better way than guessing at random. Ethereum private keys are 256 bits. Since a bit has two possible states, guessing a 256 bit sequence correctly at random has a chance of 1/2^256. There are ~10^78 atoms in the observable universe, which is roughly 2^260. Account addresses are only 160 bits long, which means that there are multiple possible private keys, but 2^160 is still a very big number, equivalent to a little bit less than the total number of atoms on Earth. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
