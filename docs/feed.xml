<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742">The Mom Test</a> is one of those books that I would never have read if I didn’t need to for work, and was instantly thrilled that I had. Having productive conversations is one of those meta-skills that gets way too little attention but underpins basically every other piece of pedagogy. This book helps you have those conversations.</p>

<p>I’ve been working through many, but not all, of the essays in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adventures-Computational-Explorer-Stephen-Wolfram/dp/1579550266">Adventures of a Computational Explorer</a> by Stephen Wolfram. I suspect we’ll know within 15-20 years whether Wolfram’s big, and somewhat esoteric, scientific bet – that the universe is built bottom-up from the emergent properties of simple computational rules – is true. But many of the essays aren’t about that at all. They present an attractive model for the productive life. (Wolfram sits in roughly the same region of my embedding space as Tyler Cowen for this reason.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1785785508">Dark Matter and Dark Energy: The Hidden 95% of the Universe</a> was interesting, clear, well-written, but like so many of these sorts of books it became rushed at just the same moment that its content got interesting.</p>

<p>I’m still digesting C. P. Snow’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Two-Cultures-Canto-Classics/dp/1107606144">The Two Cultures</a>. I suspect it might be the most important book I will read this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation">Jessica’s work on LLM feature visualisation</a> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SolidGoldMagikarp</code> token was released to, well, quite some acclaim. Cool to have the Rumbelow name known for something other than failed television retailing, Ripperology, ecoactivism, or pompous tech blogging.</p>

Some minor edits to do and then to production. Other than that, I’ve been enjoying drinking again – more on that soon – and reading, relaxing, resting. I’m taking the rest of the year off to plan and scheme.</p>

<p>Heavy fiction month. The Rest is History <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-history-podcast/185-agatha-christie">prompted me</a> to start reading some Agatha Cristie, so I sat down over the weekend and read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Then-There-Were-None-Favourite/dp/0008123209">And Then There Were None</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murder-Roger-Ackroyd-Poirot/dp/0007527527">The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleeping-Murder-Marple-Agatha-Christie/dp/000819663X">Sleeping Murder</a>. The writing is charming and lovely, and funny, even when grim. You truly get the sense that she’s building these tropes as she goes along, that the structure of the whodunnit genre was falling out of her pen as she went. Totally gripping. I’ve not enjoyed fiction this effortlessly since Station Eleven.</p>

<p>I also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Mars-Kim-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0007310161">Red Mars</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson, a good novel but about 200 pages longer than it needed to be.

Decided to restructure it all halfway through the first draft, which has meant a lot of rewriting. I’m learning a lot about how to sustain an argument over ~300 pages, and what makes for clear, technical exposition.</p>

<p>Managed to dash out something small on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/10/09/alphatensor-scaling.html">AlphaTensor and research taste</a>. Since I noticed this taste dynamic, it keeps popping up everywhere. It’s certainly not a new insight, but it’s something I see addressed an unfortunately small amount in the philosophy of science literature. The scientist is taken as some a priori given to most philosophical models of science, which, if my observation is correct, is skipping over perhaps the most important part of the analysis. Feyerabend gestures towards it in Against Method, but, again, doesn’t quite get there.</p>

<p>I’ve also been reading a lot. Winston Churchill’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Early-Life-Winston-Churchill/dp/0907871623">My Early Life</a> was a delightful, charming piece of Kipling-hued imperialism. His world-view is so remote from ours, so free of moral ambiguity. It’s a decidedly Victorian book, of heroes and adventures, a sort of anti-Le Carré. He is a wonderful writer and a gifted storyteller. Well worth a read.</p>

<p>Charles Petzold’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a> was also extremely good. He builds up an intuitive model for digital computing, from the very basics of Morse code via flashlights to complex microprocessors. This was a fill-in-the-gaps book for me, something I could read quickly – I finished it in two days – but has meaningfully added to my basic understanding. I didn’t, for instance, have a clear idea of a CPU’s clock cycle, which this book has changed superlatively. It was funny, too.</p>

<p>Just finished Simon Morden’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Planet-Natural-History-Mars/dp/1783966610/">The Red Planet: A Natural History of Mars</a>, which I’m reading in a cluster with some other Mars books. More top spacey content! Good passages on competing theories of crust formation and covers the basics of the protoplanetary disc super well. Makes me want to write something similar on Saturn (an infinitely more mysterious and beautiful planet.)</p>

<p>And, of course, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cosmos-Cosmic-Evolution-Science-Civilisation/dp/0349107033">Cosmos</a> by Carl Sagan. It has taken me 27 years to read a book that I should have read in my early teens. I felt a flickering rememberance of days past, that wide-eyed, ambitious, weird young boy, trying to understand who he was and why he was so unhappy. If I had read this book then, I suspect I’d be a scientist now – and would have become much more content with my weirdness.</p>

This quote from Noah stuck with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final thing that the liberal democratic vision needs is a way to accommodate conservatives. The divisions within the democratic world are the primary reason why the autocratic powers are able to make their case at all. But a great many people within any society, including liberal democratic ones, are socially conservative to a greater or lesser degree. If the vision of the future that liberal democracies present is one where conservative values have been wiped from the Earth, then conservatives will feel they have no choice but to embrace reactionary illiberalism.</p>

<p>Lots of anti-EA discourse began in our little corner of the Internet this month. Liam Kofi Bright made a fair point that the evaluative standards of the movement’s critics seem <a href="https://twitter.com/lastpositivist/status/1578695082748055553">radically out-of-whack</a>. David Shor <a href="https://twitter.com/davidshor/status/1578779382545530886">gave a good reply</a> about the psychology of the median EA member (via Nadia). And Nathan <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/effective-altruism#An_attempt_at_a_minimal_set_of_effective_altruism_axioms">put together an attempt at a minimal set of EA axioms</a> that is worth reading.</p>

<p>Really enjoying the <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com">Pedestrian Observations</a> blog, another good example (along with Construction Physics) of the single-issue blog that <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/">Patrick and Tyler discussed</a> back in 2017:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COLLISON: What kinds of blogs should there be more of in the world?</p>

  <p>COWEN: Single-issue blogs on issues of importance. If you take something like penal reform, an underrated cause. Prisons, I think, are barbaric, but it’s not an easy problem to solve. There’s not a quick fix. Some people do need to be constrained in some way. The idea that there should be more blogs that track that and persistently deliver the message, “Something is wrong here.”</p>

<p>Their approach is a variant of the deep reinforcement-learning-guided Monte Carlo tree search that they have applied so successfully to playing Chess and Go. What they have done, very effectively, is to design a game with the objective of finding the most efficient tensor multiplication algorithm for a matrix of some dimension.</p>

<p>There are a number of important object-level takeaways from the paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The search space for various algorithms and mathematical techniques is enormous</li>
  <li>Existing algorithms and techniques are often not provably the most globally efficient; there is room to improve</li>
  <li>We can improve an algorithm by paying attention to its implementation, as well as its theoretical virtues</li>
</ul>

<p>But it also teaches us some things about the meta-level, and the benefits of DeepMind’s distinctive approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DeepMind’s approach is scaleable vertically: the more time and compute they spend on a task, the more they can achieve.</li>
  <li>DeepMind’s approach is scaleable horizontally: the more tasks they apply their approach to, the more tasks they can achieve.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think these points suggest something important about the <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Scaling-hypothesis#scaling-hypothesis">scaling hypothesis</a>.</p>

<p>A weak version of the scaling hypothesis claims that most of what we need to improve AI performance is more compute. All we need to do is scale up the computational and data resources of a sufficiently scalable model, and we’ll get much better performance. Give the right model architecture enough data, and enough compute/time, and our problem is solvable (up to the phyical limits, or something like that.)</p>

<p>Before I begin my argument, I’ll make a presupposition: we won’t get to AGI. My hunch is that AGI is a bit of a chimera, and that progress in AI will consist mostly in the discovery and application of specialist models for narrow-domain problem solving. Some models may generalise to some extent, some may not. But over time the progress of narrow-domain AIs will far outstrip the progress in broad-domain AIs, and the market will reallocate resources accordingly.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Given this presupposition, we can ask an important question: does the weak scaling hypothesis hold?</p>

<p>In a world in which AI is applied to solving narrow-domain issues, AI researchers have two major tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How should they decide which tasks to work on?</li>
  <li>How should they encode a given problem such that it is tractable for AI to solve?</li>
</ol>

<p>(1) is hard to decide <em>a priori</em>, because it will depend on the path-dependence progress of science (and the supporting AI). Utility-maximising functions might be helpful here: what task has the lowest cost and the highest utility? But a lot will be baked into ‘cost’ and ‘utility’, and the various cost bases of tasks will change depending on how the technology evolves, what data is available, etc.</p>

<p>Instead, AI researchers will develop heuristics, industry and academic partnerships, new data sources, etc., and that will help narrow down the range of tasks susceptible to quick resolution. In short, AI researchers will rely on <em>taste</em> and experience to guide their decisions over the medium- and long-term.</p>

<p>(2) is more analysable from first principles. Tasks need to be encoded in such a way as to make them solvable by the model: the model architecture needs to be designed in such a way as to not preclude the task; the input needs to be readable by the model; the set of training data needs to be large and varied enough to prevent overfit, and contain sufficient signal to allow generalisation to inputs outside that dataset.</p>

<p>But most importantly, the game needs to be designed <em>such that it’s the sort of game that the model can play</em>. This is what DeepMind seem especially good at: they are able to express, e.g., protein folding, or tensor decomposition, in the form of a game that their RL agent can play.</p>

<p>This ability – being able to reorganise a question in the form of a model-appropriate game – doesn’t look nearly as susceptible to Moore’s Law-style exponential speed-ups. Researchers’ insights and abilities – in other terms, researcher productivity – don’t scale exponentially.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It takes time and energy and the serendipitousness of a well-functioning research lab to cultivate them. Scaling compute down to an effective cost of zero doesn’t help if we’re not using these models to attack the right issues (1) in the right way (2). The marginal next unit of compute will exhibit diminishing returns.</p>

<p>But if that’s the case, then it’s clear that <em>compute isn’t the bottleneck</em>. The bottleneck, instead, will be humans figuring out which problems to tackle (1) and how to regiment them, encode them, and design games/reward systems to get AI to solve them (2).</p>

<p>DeepMind have the absolute best people on the planet working on this stuff, and it takes them time and huge amounts of resources. So we end up back at <em>taste</em>. Researchers need time and experience to develop taste, and the ability to apply heuristics and deep domain knowledge – something much more ineffable and difficult to scale.</p>

<p>This doesn’t of course mean that there won’t be wonderful progress in many, many domains, brought about by ‘merely’ scaling the compute available. Even Kuhn is at pains to stress that ‘normal science’ is progress! But it does mean that the scaling hypothesis doesn’t necessarily scale research output at the same rate, at least not without the accompanying good taste.</p>

<p>I’ve been rewatching <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80025678">The Crown</a>, partly in preparation for the new season, partly to revisit the life of Elizabeth II, and most of all because I have had several casual conversations with friends on various topics in 20th-century British political history, and I wanted a lightweight set of touch points, nudges toward various prime ministers and political events that I might read into more deeply. As a result, almost all of my reading time has been taken up with television. It’s amazing how easily that can happen!</p>

<p>I did, however, manage to reread <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135">Stubborn Attachments</a> by Tyler Cowen. It was much less surprising and enjoyable on rereading, but I suppose that’s a sign of a book whose ideas seem to be more mainstream, whose arguments are more familiar and plausible, whose memes have sunk in to my brain. If I have any criticisms now, it’s that it isn’t ambitious or controversial enough; he caveats the demand for growth by demanding sustainable growth; he builds a broader normative pluralism into a notion of ‘Wealth+’; both of which feel more like a concession to the zeitgeist rather than a serious commitment.</p>

  <p>It developed specific ideas for how the system should work. Unlike normal think tanks, it worked at the extreme detail end of the spectrum, like drafting actual forms that the DfE could use.</p>

  <p>We thought that if we helped people develop specific projects and could actually bend the bureaucracy, we could get ‘Free Schools’ going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is interesting, because it suggests a model for <em>state-adjacent</em> institutions that support the functions of the state without being tied to the bureaucracy or subject to the incentives. Something somewhere in the midpoint between a management consultancy, a think tank, and a training institute.</p>

<p>It seems like this sort of model is beneficial in specific circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Where there is considerable state funding for a certain industry / project / goal</strong>, where ‘considerable’ is relative to the industry / project / goal. (You need more money to make a new nuclear power plant design than you do a school.)</li>
  <li><strong>Where access to that funding is reasonably competitive.</strong> This means it needs to be accessible to SMEs or small teams, rather than just Serco, G4S, the major universities, and the other big boys.</li>
  <li><strong>Where the government department distributing the funding is receptive to introductions, advice, support</strong>. A lot of the benefits seem to come from new ideas being introduced revisited through a feedback loop, so the department must be flexible enough to integrate the state-adjacent institution into its decision making – or, at least, leave its door open to such input. Generally, I suspect, departments are only really flexible in this sort of way during their first few years and for a year or two after a major shake-up (eg DoE under Gove).</li>
</ul>

<p>A few ideas where this could be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ‘ARIA Attractor’: finding individuals / teams with audacious projects, helping them refine their proposals, and using the knowledge gained from the search to help shape the department’s broader research focus.</li>
  <li>An analogous attractor for the UKRI / NIH / other ‘normal science’ funding bodies, with an emphasis on speeding up the funding application process.</li>
  <li>Standards setting and guidance for navigating the planning system, but beyond a simple planning consultancy. A team of people who work hard to befriend and effectively lobby local planning teams, giving developers large and small the opportunity to boot up to the activation energy required to get anything built. It would be useful to focus on local authorities with a recent change in governance, or with an especially acute housing problem, where the demand to do something is greater.</li>
  <li>A company to abstract away the medical licensing and compliance process and help guide new teams / University spin-offs to apply for medical licenses. Medical software, in particular, is notoriously hard to get adequate licensing for. A team dedicated to building solutions and increasing governmental awareness of these issues, working with funding bodies and NHS clinical commissioning groups, could meaningfully move the needle on what innovation we permit in the medical space (<a href="https://www.scarletcomply.com">Scarlet</a> are doing interesting things adjacent to this idea.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating and supporting these sorts of state-adjacent institutions could be an important <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pfbLKnJmDKYSPPCEW/four-focus-areas-of-effective-altruism">focus area</a> for a movement like Effective Altruism.</p>

<p>But it could also be a powerful new framing for start-ups themselves: many of these ideas could grow into profitable businesses as well as institutions with positive-sum state/business interactions.</p>

<p>Asking the question “how can the private or non-profit sector smooth over the relationship between the state and others?” is a subtly different question – and one with (in many cases perhaps) more leverage than the simpler question “how can the state do things more effectively?”</p>

<p>Why? Because it refocuses the conversation on what can be done <em>practically</em>, today, without needing large-scale systemic reform, without needing to push through the <a href="https://dominiccummings.com/tag/procurement/">ossified systems of government purchasing</a> and permits that sit in deeply suboptimal equilibria.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="politics" /><category term="housing" /><category term="startups" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Dominic Cummings’s recent ‘Snippets 5’:]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Links, July 2022</title><link href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/03/links-july-2022.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Links, July 2022" /><published>2022-08-03T11:35:28+01:00</published><updated>2022-08-03T11:35:28+01:00</updated><id>https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/03/links-july-2022</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/03/links-july-2022.html"><![CDATA[<p>ETHCC Paris, The Idler Festival, dinners at the Liberal Club, work on the book, actual work, and learning to fly; it’s been a busy month in which I deadlifted 100kg for the first time, only read a couple of books, submitted the first few chapters of <strong>Products, Protocols, and Platforms</strong>, and have found myself exhausted.

Any and all feedback welcome!</em></p>

<p>Technologists use metaphors to make <strong>skeuomorphic links</strong>, bridging old paradigms to new. The ‘desktop’ and ‘trash can’ and even the keyboard is a form of skeuomorphic link, giving users of a new platform enough conceptual and aesthetic resources to make sense of it, to feel familiar, connected to it. Computers and interfaces are physical, and rely on all the same instinctual responses, the same clusters of predispositions and responses attached to entities in the physical world. So new technologies can co-opt these instincts by creating these skeuomorphic links.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most common example of skueomorphich linkage in crypto is the metaphor of the ‘wallet’. This post argues that it is one of the most misleading.</p>

<p>A quick diversion on the structure of metaphors: metaphors behave by implying certain things about the subject based on the object. Good metaphors are good when the subject does indeed resemble the object in those ways. Good metaphors also have the nice property of illuminating the subject of the metaphor in ways that the reader doesn’t expect. A good metaphor can help reveal the shapes and contours of the subject by making us consider the subject from a new angle. ‘All the world’s a stage’, Jacques soliliquises in <strong>As You Like It</strong>, and the entrances and exits and performance that this equivalence conjures up help illuminate the human condition, revealing it to be a form of entrapment, confinement to a pre-determined script.</p>

<p>What, then, does the metaphor of ‘wallet’ imply? It suggests a few features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A wallet holds things</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A wallet holds a specific sort of thing, namely financial things (such as credit cards and cash)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A wallet is a physical item, and plays the various roles that physical items do, such as signalling style, wealth, and status</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Crypto wallets – what we’ll call ‘accounts’ from now on to avoid confusion – have none of these features. Accounts don’t hold things: accounts represent identity. Accounts aren’t limited to interacting with financial products: they interact with anything representable on the blockchain. Accounts, of course, aren’t physical items: they are an abstraction over an individual on a ledger.</p>

<p>It’s worth stopping at this point and asking why any of this matters. Isn’t it just a shallow, semantic dispute? No. Because as well as being illuminating about the subject, a metaphor can often <strong>constrain</strong> our understanding of the subject, especially if it becomes the primary mechanism through which the subject is known.</p>

<p>This has happened with the wallet metaphor in crypto, which is why I believe it’s especially important to pay attention to what wallets actually are, how the metaphor shapes our thinking, and how it limits our thinking too. All the world is a stage, maybe, but if it is we still have plenty of freedom to improvise.</p>

<h3 id="accounts-dont-hold-things">Accounts don’t hold things</h3>

<p>An account is a pair of public and private keys. A private key is used to generate a public key, and the public key is used to generate an address. So when you see account addresses such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045</code> (one of Vitalik’s accounts), what you’re really seeing is the result of passing Vitalik’s private key through the set of cryptographic functions that produce these addresses.</p>

<p>The details of how this works are interesting, but out of the scope of this post. All we need to know for now is that this process is <strong>deterministic</strong>, in the sense that it returns the same value for the same input, no matter how often you run it, and <strong>irreversible</strong>, in the sense that it’s very very hard to get the private key from the wallet address.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So if you know the private key then you can generate the public key, but you can’t (easily) go in the other direction. This is one of the reasons why it’s so important to keep your private key private: your private key is the one piece of information somebody needs to get access to your account. Fortunately, most users don’t have to worry about the content of the private key at all: they can use wallet software that holds the private key in a secure way. For product engineers, you’ll always need to keep in mind that the private key is sacred.</p>

<p>How does this link to the wallet metaphor?</p>

<p>Well, I lied a little: accounts do ‘hold’ something. They hold ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. But this is by communal assent: a group of people, incentivised to follow the same set of rules, collectively agree that a certain amount of ether is owned by a specific account, and another amount of ether is owned by a different account. It’s the collective assent that underwrites the ownership claim, not the account itself.</p>

<p>If you’ve got cash in your wallet, you actually do have cash in your wallet. A portion of the ‘state’ of the money-system is in your pocket. If you’ve got ether in your account, you’ve got a claim on the group for the amount of that ether. It’s a guarantee, secured by cryptography and incentives, that when you decide you want to do something with that ether we’ll all agree that you can.</p>

<p>So I’m also telling the truth: accounts don’t really hold that much at all, and the notion of ‘holding’ your ether and your tokens is a euphemism. Your account is the mechanism of a record of ownership. The state is not in your pocket, it’s ‘over there’.</p>

<p>This might seem a little opaque, so let’s consider some code. One of the clearest examples of how accounts don’t actually hold anything is the ERC-20 token standard.</p>

<p>This standard is the core primitive in DeFi, the basic lego brick upon which we build this cathedral. It offers a consistent interface for smart contracts that behave as a record of ledger. Contracts have to choose to implement it – that’s why it’s a standard, not a rule – but those that do share the same methods.</p>

<p>We can distil the essence of ERC-20 down to only two function signatures:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(The actual standard contains more than these two methods, but the rest are for convenience, expedience, and extensions to the functionality, rather than being central to the model of how tokens are represented by contracts that implement it.)</p>

<p>These two functions tell us everything we need to know about a piece of state. What is that piece of state? It’s a mapping from address to the number of tokens owned by that address:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mapping(address =&gt; uint256) public balanceOf;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">balanceOf</code> is a map – otherwise known as a dictionary, or an associative array – from an owner to the total amount owned. The total amount owned of what? The token that the contract represents.</p>

<p>If we want to find out how much of the token we own, we call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">balanceOf</code>, passing our address. If we want to send our tokens to somebody else, we call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transferFrom</code>, passing our address, the recipient’s address, and the amount we wish to send. The token contract does the work in updating the list it holds.</p>

<p>Think about this carefully: <strong>a token is just a list of who owns the token</strong>, plus a bit of metadata (such as the token’s name and symbol).</p>

<p>Your account doesn’t ‘hold’ anything. It doesn’t know anything about the token, per se. It just gives you a way of identifying yourself as the owner of some amount of the token. And a token is just a piece of code that understands how to update this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">balanceOf</code> map.</p>

<p>This is a very simple and powerful idea, because the token contract is able to stipulate its own rules and policies around who can transfer, who can be transferred, and what the balance is.</p>

<p>You could stipulate that only a specific whitelist of addresses should be able to receive the token, for instance, restricting ownership of the token to a known set of individuals. You could exclude certain addresses. You could require a certain amount of ether in exchange for the token, or even a certain amount of another token in exchange for the token. You could even <strong>change the amount transferred when somebody transfers it</strong>, deducting a fee. In other words, you can implement a monetary policy, controlling how the token enters the market, how it leaves it, and how it flows around between participants.</p>

<h3 id="accounts-arent-limited">Accounts aren’t limited</h3>

<p>Since the token contract is the mechanism for recording who owns what, and stipulating the rules that govern that ownership, your account isn’t limited to holding financial instruments like cash or credit cards. Tokens can be used to represent basically anything.</p>

<p>Some tokens represent non-fungible assets, things that can’t be exchanged for another asset just like it. You will have heard of NFTs, and NFTs are token contracts much like the ERC-20 contract we just discussed. The biggest difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 – the basic standard for representing NFTs – is that the parameters of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transferFrom</code> function are slightly different:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id) public virtual;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An ERC-721 contract introduces the notion of an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code>, and requires that the pair <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(owner, id)</code> is globally unique. So a specific token – that described by the contract and the specific ID the contract defines – is owned by one and only one person.</p>

<p>NFTs are often used for digital art or collectibles, but they can be used to represent ownership of lots more. In time, they may be used to represent ownership of real-world assets: houses, cars, paintings, bottles of wine.</p>

<p>NFTs can also be used for interesting, crypto-native use cases: Uniswap v3, for instance, mints an NFT that represents a deposit to a specific pool within a specific price range. Each deposit has its own custom configuration, and so the pool mints an NFT that represents your specific deposit with your specific settings.</p>

<p>Fungible tokens, too, can be used to represent many more types of things than just those that map to financial value. They can represent governance rights, as they do with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRIBE</code> token, which grants the right to vote on proposals of the Tribe DAO. (At the time of writing, most governance tokens grant voting rights on a quantity basis: if you have more tokens, your vote represents more of the. But this isn’t the only model for governance design made possible by the ERC-20 token standard). They can also represent other sorts of values, such as carbon credits, or reputation, or points accumulated in a game.</p>

<p>The point is that the ‘wallet’ metaphor suggests a constraint on the sorts of things that can be ‘held’. Since accounts don’t ‘hold’ things, the design space for what sorts of ownership and participation claims they can represent is much, much bigger.</p>

<h3 id="accounts-arent-physical-items">Accounts aren’t physical items</h3>

<p>This might seem like a silly point to make, but the fact that accounts aren’t physical items runs a little deeper than the obvious. Accounts aren’t physical items: they are abstractions over an individual, a face you can show to the blockchain.</p>

<p>And this means that your accounts aren’t tied to one place. If you know your private key, you can use your account in whatever interface you want.</p>

<p>This means that <strong>different interfaces can display different aspects of the same account</strong>. Some interfaces – CHECK: such as what? – put an emphasis on NFT collectibles, a kind of gallery. Others might focus on the purely financial aspects of the account, its deposits and loans and investments. Perhaps an interface could be built around governance, showing the proposals and votes and engagements with protocols. Perhaps another could be built around whatever gaming tokens the account has claims to. And so on.</p>

<p>When you start to consider these sorts of product implications of the fact that accounts aren’t physical items, it makes you realise that the design space for account interfaces is co-extensive – overlapping with – the design space for tokens themselves.</p>

<p>It also pushes the sorts of signalling properties we mentioned earlier elsewhere. Perhaps people do signal with their <strong>wallet software</strong> – i.e. their account interfaces – a little, using a newer or more feature-complete piece of software to indicate the sort of user they are, the sorts of things they are interested in. But the account itself is a very lightweight thing.</p>

<p>And because it’s lightweight, it can be transported, as we’ve discussed. It can also be ‘hosted’ on-chain, which opens up the possibility of smart contract wallets and multi-signature wallets.</p>

<h3 id="accounts-are-identity">Accounts are identity</h3>

<p>So what is an account, then, if not a wallet?</p>

<p>My answer: an account is an <strong>identity</strong>. It is a way of informing other participants that you are who you say you are. It is a username and password. It is a mechanism to authenticate yourself.</p>

<p>If accounts are identity, then it means you can separate out your identities depending on different contexts of usage. You might use an account to trade, another account to represent your investments, a third to hold your claims to any artwork or collectibles. You might use accounts for different platforms with different risk profiles, or with different privacy considerations. You can separate out your identities in whatever way you choose, isolating your public, on-chain behaviour into different categories. The ownership of a private key gives you full control over what aspect of yourself you wish to show to the world.</p>

<p>Products built on Ethereum need to understand this multiplicity of identities, and implement support for it in a deep way. We’ll see how this works more concretely in other posts. But for now, consider that <strong>your identity goes with you wherever you take it</strong>. And where your identity goes, so do your claims of ownership.</p>

<p>This, combined with the standardisation of interfaces such as ERC-20 and ERC-721, increases the power of the interfaces we can build substantially. To take a simple example: a tool for listing whatever ERC-20-compatible tokens are ‘held’ by an account will work with <strong>any token that meets the requirements of that interface</strong>. It’s as if PayPal could support all currencies from day one, with no extra development work.</p>

<p>The wallet metaphor is generally broken, then, and can severely constrain your imagination vis-a-vis what accounts are capable of. For sure, there are ways in which an account can seem like a wallet: when you lose your account, just like your wallet, you lose the money in it; to that extent, the metaphor is true. But it’s true for different reasons. If you lose a physical wallet you’ve actually lost the cash inside it. If you lose a crypto wallet, you’ve lost your ability to prove you are the person who owns the cash.</p>

<p>We are likely to continue using the term ‘wallet’, since that’s what the community uses, and there’s not much marginal benefit in changing this sort of heavily-entrenched meme. I use ‘wallet’ and ‘account’ interchangeably. But I hope this chapter has given you a sense of how accounts actually work, and why the design space for them is an awful lot bigger than a piece of folded leather that you keep in your pocket.</p>

      <p>How hard? There’s no better way than guessing at random. Ethereum private keys are 256 bits. Since a bit has two possible states, guessing a 256 bit sequence correctly at random has a chance of 1/2^256. There are ~10^78 atoms in the observable universe, which is roughly 2^260. Account addresses are only 160 bits long, which means that there are multiple possible private keys, but 2^160 is still a very big number, equivalent to a little bit less than the total number of atoms on Earth. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

I ran the Edinburgh Marathon, my first marathon ever, in four hours and 33 minutes. I wrote a piece on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/05/24/decentralisation-is-a-tradeoff-space.html">Decentralisation as a trade-off space</a>.</p>

<p>To prepare for a debate with my friend David, I read two books on the history of housing development: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-That-Solid-Housing-Disaster/dp/1846147158">All That is Solid</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Municipal-Dreams-Rise-Council-Housing/dp/178478740X">Municipal Dreams</a>. The latter was very good. The former descended into Tory-bashing in the key of Owen Jones, which might be righteous but is also a little tiresome. I also read bits of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Order-without-Design-Markets-Cities/dp/0262038765">Order Without Design</a>, which was truly excellent; it’s good to see urban theory that grounds itself in, and has respect for, economics.</p>

<p>I also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diaries-Two-People-Alastair-Campbell/dp/0099493462">the second volume of Alastair Campbell’s diaries</a>, covering 1997-1999 and the first few salvos of a triumphantly New Labour. The diary format is excellent, since you get an obviously singular perspective as it unfolds. I hadn’t realised quite how little communication mattered in the civil service prior to Blair; lots of Campbell’s agonies involved getting various govt departments to coordinate messaging, routing comms through Number 10. I also had very little idea of how much work went into the Good Friday agreement, or how tenuous it was. Many many chances for it to fall apart. Had Paisley or Trimble or Adams woken up on the wrong side of bed on the wrong morning and the whole thing would have been doomed. From inside government policy seems much more chaotic and stochastic than I had suspected (which might be a reason to be less worried, at least on the margin, about <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch tendencies</a>.)</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shadow-Moon-Challenging-Tranquility-1965-1969/dp/B01DJS9E1A">In the Shadow of the Moon</a> while falling asleep most nights, a very thorough set of biographies and history of the Gemini missions, up to Apollo 11.</p>

<p>As for other links, and continuing on the theme of housing, I also read a few good papers worth reading if the subject appeals to you. Anthony Breach’s <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-06-13-Capital-cities-how-the-planning-system-creates-housing-shortages-and-drives-wealth-inequality.pdf">Capital Cities: How the Planning System Creates Housing Shortages and Drives Wealth Inequality</a> was extremely clear and thorough, UK-specific, and perfect for preparing for an argument with David. <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/">The Housing Theory of Everything</a> helps drive home why this matters so much. YIMBY is a moral argument as much as an economic one.</p>

<p>Campbell’s diaries got me on a bit of a New Labour kick, so I watched <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p09wgbfk/blair-brown-the-new-labour-revolution-series-1-episode-1">last year’s excellent series</a> on Blair and Brown and the 13 years of New Labour government. I’ve also been enjoying <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-politics">The Rest is Politics</a> podcast, hosted by Campbell and Rory Stewart.</p>

<p>Dwarkesh Patel wrote a good post on <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/barbell-strategies">applying the ‘Barbell Strategy’ to everyday life</a>: reframing habit formation and intellectual projects in terms of oscillating between intense focus on one thing and the simplest, lowest-effort thing possible –– which is often nothing at all.</p>

<p>Ken Shiriff is writing some truly excellent, deep work on the technical substrate of the Apollo missions. This is <a href="http://www.righto.com/2022/05/talking-with-moon-inside-apollos.html">a post on the premodulation processor</a>, the signal combinator and splitter in the command module.</p>

<p>We can now make clocks <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/02/jila-atomic-clocks-measure-einsteins-general-relativity-millimeter-scale">so sensitive that they can detect the relativistic difference caused by being one milimetre deeper in the Earth’s gravity well</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/blob/main/projects/OPT/chronicles/OPT175B_Logbook.pdf">a logbook documented while building and deploying</a> one of their NLP models. More companies and people should do this sort of stuff.</p>

<p>Finally, I signed a contract with Apress this week to publish a book on Product Engineering on Ethereum. My aim is to raise the relative status of product engineers – those of us who build everything around smart contracts, UIs, tooling, infrastructure – and explore how the unique processing model of Ethereum puts important constraints on the way we build software. I’ll be posting some pieces here as I work through the first draft, so keep an eye out if you’re interested.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="links" /><category term="ethereum" /><category term="housing" /><category term="urbanism" /><category term="economics" /><category term="productivity" /><category term="politics" /><category term="science" /><category term="books" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[May was a fine month with lots of social engagements, less writing than I wanted, but quite a lot of reading.

<ol>
  <li>Many nodes are run across many jurisdictions; computation happens in a way that can’t ever be shut down or censored</li>
  <li>Individuals can access the system for <a href="https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/1528432799941808130">whatever nefarious purposes</a> they wish, without the need for inter alia KYC checks</li>
  <li>Power is completely diffused rather than concentrated in any one party; therefore, no individual party is responsible, either legally, operationally, morally, or all of the above.</li>
</ol>

<p>These sorts of conditions actually refer to what I’ll call ‘maximal decentralisation’ – a system which is decentralised in every way possible, up to whatever point of diminishing marginal returns seems appropriate. It is different from decentralisation, which refers to a system that can have more or less participation, more or less accessibility, more or less diffused power.</p>

<p>This might seem like an unimportant semantic distinction, but not all semantic distinctions are meaningless, and some are indeed important. How we define our terms matters, because it limns the shape of what we build and gives us criteria against which we evaluate our success. Moreover, if we disagree over what we mean by a term like ‘decentralisation’, we end up arguing fruitlessly. We exchange claims and both sides miss the point.</p>

<p>A lot of crypto people also believe, somewhat reflexively, that we should be aiming for maximal decentralisation. The worst crypto-fanatics are just as ideological as the worst crypto-sceptics. This is a problem. People shouldn’t be fanatical.</p>

<p>For almost every category, maximalism is bad. It ties you into a priori commitments, which reduce your optionality and cripple your ability to adjust to new facts. Strong beliefs are important, but they should generally be held weakly. It also makes you much more likely to act tribally. Humans are tribal, and ‘decentralise everything’ can become a rallying cry, a standard around which troops array for battle. It makes technical questions political, and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer">politics is the mind-killer</a>.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Crypto people shouldn’t be fanatical, because computing is the art of the science of trade-offs, and ‘decentralisation’ gives us a lot more room for manoeuvre than either its critics or fanatics seem to allow. Trade-offs are useful, and understanding the trade-off space is most of the work.</p>

<p>I know that crypto people don’t actually want decentralisation per se, because when you ask why decentralisation matters, you get answers like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It makes the technology more accessible and more censor-resistant. It gives broader access to a broader set of people, especially those less well-served by existing financial infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which means that their motivations are prior to decentralisation. They want accessibility! They want censorship-resistance, and greater equality of opportunity!</p>

<p>We also want other things. Decentralisation means more competition, and more competition means more innovation. (Diversity is good! Let a thousand flowers bloom!) The ideas being generated and built upon by the crypto community are not commodities: they are meaningfully new contributions to a meaningfully new technology stack; we get more ideas when we have a more competitive space, and we get more competition when people are able to use the technology and gain access to the liquidity needed to prove the new ideas out.</p>

<p>More subtly, another important corollary of decentralisation is that it leads to implicit coordination through standards. And standards make composability possible. So decentralisation is also good because it leads to more composable technologies.</p>

<p>So how then can we think about decentralisation in a more yielding way? How can we make it more supportive of our broader aims – accessibility, censorship-resistance, competition, composability – without holding ourselves hostage to its demands, on the one hand, or giving our opponents a stick to beat us with, on the other?</p>

<p>First, we must realise that decentralisation is a spectrum. It isn’t a binary state. Systems can be more or less decentralised, and what we’re actually arguing over is how decentralised a given system should be.</p>

<p>Second, we must realise that there are different sorts of components in a web3 system, and decentralisation doesn’t just apply to the computation. There are the RPC nodes, the API interface into the computation layer: they can be more or less decentralised. There are frontends, which serve user-friendly interfaces to interact with the contracts via these RPC nodes: they can be more or less decentralised. There is the data itself, the state, which can be more or less decentralised. There is the liquidity, the value locked in the system, which can also be thought of as more or less decentralised. Etc etc etc.</p>

<p>Third, we must realise that how decentralised a given system should be depends on the purpose of that system. A platform that needs to perform a lot of complicated computation can trade off a bit of decentralisation by pulling some computation off-chain.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Many web3 frontends use the semi-decentralised <a href="https://thegraph.com/en/">The Graph</a> to provide indexing, trading off some centralisation in exchange for faster data retrieval. Almost no web3 frontend uses decentralised alternatives to the substrate of internet technologies on which they sit, DNS and web hosts and friends. This is all okay.</p>

<p>Fourth, we must realise that often just the ability to decentralise means that the goals of decentralisation can be achieved. In other words, centralised parts of a decentralised system don’t immediately make the system totally centralised – it’s not a binary – and therefore useless vis-a-vis the goals of decentralising. This is one of the reasons why <a href="http://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">moxie</a> is wrong: while it’s true that there are a few dominant hosts of RPC nodes, such as <a href="https://www.alchemy.com">Alchemy</a>, it is very easy to run nodes, and would not be especially capital intensive to start competitors.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Alchemy won’t abuse their power, because if they did it would be extremely easy to compete with them. The fact that the computation layer and its implementation – e.g. the geth codebase – is permissionlessly accessible means that there are downstream pressures on people who use those implementations to not abuse their power. ‘Counterfactually decentralised’ is a real thing!</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, we must realise that we have a choice, as builders and consumers, and that the truest expression of a decentralised system is one in which individuals are given freedom to engage (in the broadest possible sense) with the project (in the broadest possible sense) –– on their own terms. On this count, at least, crypto seems to be doing well, even though aspects of it are indeed centralised.</p>

<p>My point is that crypto-fanatics and -sceptics alike seem to think that the fight is over whether decentralisation is ‘necessary’, which is about as helpful as asking whether a bridge is strong enough, or a cow is fat enough, or a child is confident enough.</p>

<p>Necessary for what?</p>

      <p>I hope to write more about the relationship between fact-questions and values-questions in the future.

I wrote three pieces on this blog: something technical on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/04/02/hd-wallets-and-network-switching.html">HD wallets and network switching</a>, something equally technical <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/04/03/a-quick-note-on-web_accessible_resources-in-Safari-Web-Extensions.html">about Safari iOS extensions</a>, and the aforementioned <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/04/06/solidity-fridays-transmissions11.html">notes on the t11s episode of Solidity Fridays</a>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my own contributions, this was a good month for interesting reading. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Star-Builders-Nuclear-Fusion-Planet/dp/1474611583">The Star Builders</a> is a very accessible and fast read on the why and how of nuclear fusion. It’s a contribution to the – I think underrated – genre of “here’s a plausible pathway to some major scientific discovery, and a set of good reasons to be optimistic we’re on that pathway” science writing. One for the techno-optimists’ bookshelves.</p>

<p>Emily St. John Mandel’s new novel, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sea-Tranquility-Emily-John-Mandel/dp/1529083494">Sea of Tranquility</a>, is out, and is splendid. I found some of the science fiction elements a little bit hamfisted, and this is definitely Mandel finding her voice and her groove. But it’s worth reading, especially if you’ve read Station Eleven (one of the best novels I’ve read in the last few years) and The Glass Hotel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seven-Brief-Lessons-Physics-Rovelli/dp/0141981725/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1651344159&amp;sr=1-1">Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</a> was enjoyable, too. Best supplemented by something more technical, I think.</p>

<p>Finally, I just finished <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/London-Under-Peter-Ackroyd/dp/0099287374">London Under</a> by Peter Ackroyd. I <em>loved</em> Ackroyd’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Thomas-More-Peter-Ackroyd/dp/0749386401">biography of Sir Thomas More</a>, but hadn’t read any of his other books. He’s an excellent writer. There were a handful of places where I thought he made non-sequiturs – the sort of non-sequiturs quite common in a certain style of proto-academic culture writing – but I’m being really picky.</p>

<p>The excellent Noah Smith did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaMgZSd3gV4">an interview</a> with the excellent David Roberts on climate change, climate tech, climate activism, writing in public. Both combative and thoughtful throughout.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tracers-in-the-dark-welcome-to-video-crypto-anonymity-myth/">challenging post on child abuse videos</a> and a global coordinated effort to bust a specific site and its clients. A long and difficult read but very worthwhile.</p>

<p>Something to keep an eye on – an economics lab <a href="https://start.edgeryders.eu/page/15452">imaginging systems through science-fiction</a>.</p>

<p>In case you’ve woken in a sweat, panicked that you’re not subscribed to enough substacks (subsstack?), <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30983517">here’s a list</a> of good, subject-specific newsletters.</p>

<p>Very very good and comprehensive and thorough <a href="https://cdrprimer.org/read">guide to direct carbon renewal</a>. We need to do more here; Stripe and others have <a href="https://frontierclimate.com">launched an advanced market commitment to help</a>.</p>

<p>Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/expanding-global-payouts-with-crypto">have also launched crypto payments</a>.</p>

<p>The beginning of the conversation, not the end of it, but <a href="https://austinvernon.site/blog/starshipsuperweapon.html">some reflections on SpaceX’s technologies and warfare</a>.</p>

<p>Really enjoyed <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/londons-lost-ringways/">this article on the urban history and development of London’s planned and, blisfully, abandoned Ringways</a>, the persistence of political structures and the perversity of political incentives, and the pitfalls of top-down urban planning. Works in Progress is putting out a lot of excellent stuff.</p>

<p>On top of my normal reading, I listened to three audiobooks this month, all spacey or science-related content. Another for the techno-optimist bookshelf, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Case-Space-Revolution-Spaceflight-Possibility/dp/B08CVTT36C">The Case for Space by Zubrin</a> was good fun, opinionated, rigorous and rather inspiring.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Forces-of-Nature/dp/B01NA0F2DD">Forces of Nature</a>, from the same authorship of The Planets (mentioned last month), was also splendid. The narrator is truly excellent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/080322639X">Into That Silent Sea: Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961-1965 by French and Burgess</a> is part of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B088T4M553">a broader series</a> of histories on various topics in spaceflight. The whole series is pretty good, with only a few exceptions, and this isn’t one of them. Meticulous and narrative-driven, I learnt a lot about Gagarin, Leonov, the Mercury Seven, and the politics that made it all happen. I’ll be continuing this series.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are my notes in case somebody else finds them useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When emitting events, t11s emits instances of the contract rather than the address directly; the compiler will swap it out for an address anyway, but this approach gives you greater type safety</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE2</code> to revert if the contract has already been deployed, by adding a salt of the underlying address to the deployment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Addresses are 20 bytes, salts have to be 32 bytes. So we call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fillLast12Bytes</code> to add the remaining bytes (provided in Solmate’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bytes32</code> library)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gas cost of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> is equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!=</code> when the comparator is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>, more expensive otherwise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Illustration of his opinionated approach to smart contract development: “the performance of the code for users who aren’t stupid matters” - that’s why the [[ERC20]] implementation in [[Solmate]] doesn’t stop you from transferring into the contract’s address. “I’m not raising the cost for everyone else”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fdiv</code> is like division, but accounting for the bases. ‘Scale this down by the contract’s base’. Multiply the numerator by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">baseUnit</code> and then divide the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numerator * baseUnit</code> by the denominator. Also checks for overflow on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numerator * baseUnit</code>, since overflow isn’t protected in assembly calls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, keep external calls all the way at the end of the function – including after any events are emitted – to make reentrancy more difficult.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More important with eg ERC777 since eg <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safeTransferFrom</code> might allow arbitrary code execution (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removing things from the end of an array is significantly cheaper than from the beginning, since in the latter case you have to move everything over.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uint256 currentIndex = withdrawalQueue.length - 1; for (; ; currentIndex--)</code> is better in this case than initialising the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uint56 i = withdrawalQueue.length - 1</code> since we’re only doing effects (the tx will revert by underflow automatically), so we don’t need to check the length. Saves gas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trusted</code> boolean to the strategies, which is then checked on deposit and withdrawal. Makes it easier for EOAs to manage vaults without having to be wrapped in some other contract. Also makes it possible to disable withdrawal from strategies easily if they’re malicious in some way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two reads to the same struct from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStrategyData[strategy]</code> has no extra gas cost, since it gets optimised by the compiler into one single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SLOAD</code>. &amp; makes it clearer to read by a dev where it’s coming from.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unchecked</code> when you know you won’t underflow or overflow, and so can therefore do without the safety. Saves gas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unchecked</code> isn’t leaky - it won’t uncheck in nested function calls</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implementation of Compound’s cToken is a little funky, since in a lot of places function calls return an error code rather than revert. So sometimes you need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require(cToken.blah() == 0)</code> to ensure it succeeded.</p>

Developing these new extensions is challenging.</p>

<p>A small contribution to changing that:</p>

<p>By default, extension files that aren’t explicitly whitelisted in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manifest.json</code> file are inaccessible from the browser. One common use case of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content.js</code> script is to inject scripts into the same execution environment of the active web page. However, no such injection is possible unless the loaded file is whitelisted.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manifest.json</code> spec <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources/">defines</a> a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">web_accessible_resources</code> parameter, which allows extensions to whitelist resources for access from the browser.</p>

<p>Thus, the following whitelist:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"web_accessible_resources": ["images/foo.png"]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Allows you to generate the resource’s URL with the following code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>browser.runtime.getURL("images/foo.png")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which gives you the following sort of URL:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>safari-web-extension://2AB33852-D69B-4ED6-99AD-A4839DFEC7ED/images/foo.png
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The ID directly after the protocol in that URL is generated on a per-browser-instance basis, so you can’t guess it ahead of time. You have to call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getURL</code> to generate it.</p>

<p>There are two important things that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/web_accessible_resources">the API documentation</a> doesn’t specify, which took me some time to figure out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">browser.runtime.getURL</code> is only defined inside the extension’s execution contexts.</strong> So the content.js and background.js files are fine, but the webpage itself is not. If you want to use it in the webpage context, you’ll need to generate the URL in the extension somewhere and communicate it via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">window.postMessage</code> event trigger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Any values used in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">web_accessible_resources</code> parameter must be nested under a subdirectory.</strong> If you try to call a top-level file (such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getURL("foo.png")</code>), the URL will generate fine, but the file itself won’t be loadable. The browser will simply report it as inaccessible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this saves somebody else some time.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="javascript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Safari Web Extension mechanism is an important step forward for iOS apps – and a significant part of my current project, on which more soon – but the documentation is a little fragmented and the tooling isn’t nearly solid enough just yet.

<p>What’s important is that the process of derivation is very difficult to reverse, in the same way that a hashing function is difficult to reverse: the chance of you guessing the private key correctly at random is about the same as selecting one atom from all the atoms in the universe – and there’s no better way than guessing at random.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> We can therefore use the wallet address publicly, being able to prove mathematically that we own it, without ever leaking information about the private key we used to generate it.</p>

<p>This works great, until you need more than one wallet. You might be concerned about privacy, or you might want to keep certain types of transactions separated for tax or other organisational reasons. If you have more than one wallet, you need to manage more than one set of private keys, back each key up separately, store each key separately, restore each key separately, etc. This presents a user experience problem: it is inconvenient, and clunky, and pushes a lot of the infosec responsibility onto the user. That might be acceptable for a bunch of nerds or anarcho-libertarians, but isn’t going to cut it for the median user.</p>

<p>The agreed-upon solution to these UX problems is Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, proposed in the Bitcoin BIP-32/44 standards and used by most other chains. This post considers this standard, how we’re not meeting it, and why it matters.</p>

<p>The plan, in three sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A short overview of what HD wallets are. Feel free to skip over this if you’re familiar with the spec already.</li>
  <li>A discussion of how common wallets are not meeting this standard</li>
  <li>A discussion of why that matters, and what we could do about it.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hd-wallets">HD Wallets</h4>

<p>Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets take the basic derivation mechanism and encode <em>structure</em> into it. We take a master password – a single thing for the user to remember, to back up, etc. – and combine it with a <em>path</em>, a string following an a priori agreed-upon schema that allows us to generate multiple private keys from the same master password.</p>

<p>But it needn’t actually have much structure at all. You could simply take a master password and append <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code>, and so on, to generate different wallet addresses. This strategy would generate perfectly usable wallets with no obvious link between them. And since the generation process follows the same general sort of process as it does for the single-key case, the generation process produces hashed values that are similarly difficult to reverse.</p>

<p>We therefore only really need two pieces of information to calculate our wallet address:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our master password</li>
  <li>Some sort of <em>seed</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The master password is the user’s responsibility; it’s her input, her secret. What seed should we use?</p>

<p>One option is to let the user specify whatever sort of seed she wishes. But this doesn’t really solve our problem: instead of multiple private keys, we instead have to deal with a single password plus multiple paths. We’ve just given ourselves more passwords to remember.</p>

<p>Another is to do what I suggested above: append an incrementing integer to the end of it to generate different wallets. This is equivalent to giving ourselves more passwords, but at least there’s some rationale to it: our first wallet has a 1 at the end, our second wallet a 2, etc. It gives us some psychological safety: it means that our wallet is recoverable (assuming we can remember which number we used to generate it, or assuming we don’t mind iterating through a few guesses). This approach is fine, as far as it goes, but this is crypto, so, given the opportunity, we should make it more complicated.</p>

<p>A third approach is to develop a <em>common standard</em> for generating our seeds with more variables than just an incrementing number. This way, we can describe a tree structure independent of its values, embedding multiple values with which we might want to generate differing wallets. The benefit to this approach is that we can encode information about the purpose of the wallet into the seed itself, and then recover it later using our knowledge of those purposes without having to remember many arbitrary numbers. The standard gives us the template, and the purposes give us the values of the variables; all we have to do is fill them in. The other benefit to using a common standard is that wallet software can implement the standards too, so you don’t need to generate the wallets off-site somewhere.</p>

<p>This standard is called <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">BIP-44</a> (it was originally a Bitcoin standard), and it presents this exactly this sort of predictable tree structure that we’ve been discussing. The goal here is minimises user input and maximise the number of wallets that can be generated with a single master password.</p>

<p>The standard calls the seed a <em>derivation path</em>, since it’s a path in a tree that we append to a master password and use the resulting string to derive a public address. The standard gives derivation paths the following structure:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>m/purpose'/coin'/account'/change/index
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here’s the trick: most of these values are knowable by the wallet software, based on what sort of wallet you’re using:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">purpose</code> is always <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">44'</code>.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> They gave it a value to allow them to upgrade the standard if they wanted to.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coin</code> varies depending on the crypto network. For instance, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coin = 60'</code> is Ethereum mainnet, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coin = 966'</code> is Polygon.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">account</code> gives the wallet a degree of freedom to support multiple user accounts (c.f. to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/username</code> directory on your OS)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">change</code> will generally be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>; it refers to whether the wallet should be used externally, or whether it should be use internal to the wallet for Bitcoin-based transaction change reasons. I’ve read somewhere that Ethereans sometimes use it, though for what I’m not sure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only non-guessable input value is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index</code>, which gives the user a degree of freedom to generate multiple wallets for under the same tree. This parameter is why the user can generate many wallets for a single password: she can keep incrementing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index</code> to generate more! It’s also exactly the same as my much simpler idea discussed previously.</p>

<p>These parameters then get put into the structure, like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>m/44'/60'/0'/0/2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The structure then gets combined with the master password (or, more precisely, with a key generated from the master password), and users (or wallets) can vary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coin</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">account</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index</code> to generate various wallet addresses.</p>

<h4 id="existing-uis-and-a-subtle-incompatibility">Existing UIs and a Subtle Incompatibility</h4>

<p>This isn’t a huge, bombshell-dropped discovery, I’ll admit it, but I’ve noticed that most wallets with support for both HD wallets and network switching don’t actually implement the BIP-44 correctly, or, at least, there is a tension between the model used for network switching and the model used for wallet generation.</p>

<p>Generally, what happens is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users add a master password (or its equivalent in the form of a mnemonic phrase) from which the wallet derives a single keypair</li>
  <li>As far as I can make out, the ‘default wallet’ generated through this mechanism still uses the HD standard, it just relies implicitly upon the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m/44'/60'/0'/0/0</code> derivation path (i.e. “give me external index 0 at account 0 for the Ethereum chain”).</li>
  <li>When the user switches between compatible chains – from Mainnet to Arbitrum, for instance – the wallet software uses the same wallet address and private key to sign new transactions. It just switches the RPC endpoint it uses to make the request.</li>
</ul>

<p>If wallets were to follow the standard correctly, they would be varying the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coin</code> value when switching networks, generating different wallet addresses for use depending on the network being used. In other words, according to BIP-44 at least, there’s no such thing as a ‘cross-network address’ – and existing wallets ignore this subtle fact entirely.</p>

<p>I’ve been looking at how various different wallets handle this, and they all seem to do the same thing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Metamask’s network switcher is <a href="https://metaschool.so/articles/how-to-change-add-new-network-metamask-wallet/">entirely independent</a> from the wallet list, allowing the user to switch networks on the current wallet, even if that wallet was generated through a derivation path</li>
  <li>MyEtherWallet do the same thing, <a href="https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/blob/8703b504e8b1166877ac7b2cc2a75e08614bd8a4/src/core/store/wallet/actions.js#L34">switching the network URL</a> used for chain interactions and not (as far as I can see) adjusting the corresponding wallets.</li>
  <li>Similarly, there is nothing in <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/client-api#approve-session-request-connect">the WalletConnect spec</a> preventing this behaviour, meaning that any HD-compatible wallet software using the protocol facilitates wallet-independent network switching</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is not so much that nobody’s trying to follow the spec. The problem is that the spec is ambiguous with respect to the UI in which it’s being implemented. The community therefore has implicitly converged on this non-standard behaviour because of the ostensible UI benefits. This has created an implicit standard incompatible with the original BIP-32/44 proposals.</p>

<p>It gets even more confusing when you notice that there is a third, Ethereum-specific standard, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-601">EIP-601</a>, designed to modify the BIP-44 standard for Ethereum use cases. From a brief google, I can’t see any mentions of 601 that aren’t merely links to the spec itself. But this ambiguity – what should happen to the valid wallet list when the user switches networks? – isn’t resolved by EIP-601 either.</p>

<p>This ambiguity is born because the BIP-32/44 standards were built around the assumption that the different networks a user might switch between were mutually incompatible. It didn’t foresee the rise of EVM-compatible layer 2s, and a range of dapps built to run on several of them concurrently, and therefore the capacity for the user to switch between them easily, in-app.</p>

<h4 id="why-this-matters-and-what-to-do">Why this matters, and what to do</h4>

<p>Of course, this doesn’t seem like a critical problem – there are bigger problems we could be tackling, for sure. Indeed, there’s even something comforting about going from Polygon to Ethereum Mainnet and taking your address with you. It’s certainly convenient. But this isn’t what the BIP-32/44 specs say, and I think there actually are good reasons to obey them more precisely:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It makes it possible to upgrade the spec in the future.</strong> The standard can evolve safely, and those implementing it correctly are able to evolve without having to hack in workarounds for backward compatibility, and keep track of previous fringe behaviours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It makes interoperability with other wallets easier.</strong> Wallet onboarding and offboarding isn’t a light matter; the more activation energy required to move to one wallet from another, or from no wallet at all, the more intimidating crypto as a whole will become to the marginal user. Problems at the tail-end often get publicised more than problems at the mean.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Not doing so undermines one of the main reasons to use HD wallets in the first place:</strong> HD wallets allow you to keep public references to different addresses separated, increasing privacy. A wallet address that comes with you cross-network just makes your transactions that much easier to track.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Fortunately, I don’t believe that the UI concessions made by existing wallet implementations need to be locked in. There are some steps that wallets could take today, such as triggering a confirmation model when changing networks, that would enable users to opt-out of the spec. Many users don’t knowingly use HD wallets at all; in these cases, the default behaviour could just clear the wallet list and regenerate using the standard specs on network change.</p>

<p>Or, alternatively, we could develop a new, more parsimonious standard to capture the semantics of cross-chain wallets, compatible with the current UI approach. One simple method would be to amend the current spec such that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">network = 0</code> means ‘no specific network’, allowing cross-chain wallets to be represented in the existing spec. If a network changes while a user is connected with a wallet known to be generated with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">network = 0</code>, the wallet persists.</p>

<p>Either way, this is the exactly the sort of subtle incompatibility that could prove to be an increasing nuisance, compounded by the ongoing growth in usage of layer 2s. Our standards for network switching were designed at a time when the only networks we would switch between were testnets. Today, the UI implications of network switching are a lot more important. And, today, that is incompatible with one of the most useful standards we have for managing multiple wallets.</p>

<p>Multiple wallets, multiple networks, good UX. We don’t need to pick only two.</p>

The median person is unlikely to become an expert, and pursuing expertise can be very costly, so perhaps there is a better path for the median person to take. This path is, roughly, to explore more, learn broadly, and rely on the interconnections between ideas to add value.</p>

<p>If that discussion is at all salient for you, a natural next question is how one ought best cultivate the characteristics of an enthusiastic amateur.</p>

<p>With the very big caveat that I’m still figuring this out myself, here are a few ways that seem to work well for expanding my interests and developing the sorts of knowledge that are additive rather than distracting:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Optimise for breadth.</strong> This might seem like trivial advice given the definition of an enthusiastic amateur, but it’s amazing how much more breadth can be gained by asking at a higher-than-normal rate “does this decision expose me in a meaningful way to more interesting stuff”. Follow blogs on subjects you know nothing about. Listen to lots of podcasts from lots of experts. Get used to clicking around Wikipedia aimlessly.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid optimising for depth.</strong> I think optimising for depth is the default pathway, in many important ways, for lots of mostly contingent cultural reasons. If you want to be an enthusiastic amateur, you should resist the urge to optimise for depth. A lot of the stuff you do will <strong>also</strong> involve developing depth in a given field, but you shouldn’t be afraid to forgo depth in service of breadth, and then let depth develop naturally across a range of subjects, rather than by sacrificing breadth on the altar of depth.</li>
  <li><strong>Cultivate enthusiastic amateur friends</strong>. Enthusiastic amateurs usually have a richer and more idiosyncratic answer to “how can you do X better?”, generally because they actually end up answering a different question: “how do I think about X differently?”. They’re also very likely to recommend books and other media sources that might stray from expert’s canon. (<a href="https://interintellect.com/">Interintellect</a> is a good place to start! So is Twitter!)</li>
  <li><strong>Cultivate expert friends too</strong>, but recognise their expertise might skew their answer away from breadth. Expert friends can teach you things you will never learn otherwise. They’re extremely good at nudging you away from dead-ends in their fields. It can also be a valuable way to get personalised feedback on your projects that sit in their domains. But experts are also more likely to rank you and your work against the norms and common knowledge in their field, which can lead you to develop the same sorts of blind spots that they do. It’s difficult to see the water you swim in.</li>
  <li><strong>Quit more</strong>. Quit early, quit often. Discipline is overrated. Projects that languish <a href="http://jamierumbelow.net/paused.html">can be discarded</a>. You shouldn’t forget that the sunk cost fallacy is still a fallacy, even when you’re labouring under it. If you’re at all like me, you should give yourself more permission to halt, reverse, rework or otherwise abandon some interests and projects as others begin to take their place. You’ll float back to things as and when you’re in the mood.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Anki and take notes.</strong> Breadth means you need to build more branches on the knowledge tree. You’ve got fewer coat-hooks, as it were, upon which to hang new facts. Popular science television, for instance, even the not-so-good stuff, is usually packed full of non-obvious observations and the distilled wisdom of experts. Even more so for the <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">really</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage">good</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilisation_(TV_series)">stuff</a>; even more so still for books. People consume this content passively, and so don’t retain it. The trick is to consume actively.</li>
  <li><strong>Talk more.</strong> Connections between ideas often rely on pragmatics – how things are said, and in what context – rather than the actual semantic content of the connection. So talking about your latest subject of interest with smart people in a variety of different contexts can help you see beyond the standard narrative and see links that others might not.</li>
  <li><strong>Write more.</strong> This is the sort of trite advice you hear often, but it can’t be repeated enough: so much of the process of writing just is thinking, and forcing yourself to write helps you retain what you’re learning and distill an argument or theory or model to its essential components.</li>
  <li><strong>Think about thinking.</strong> How can you better distill an idea to its essence? How can you better think about the content you’re consuming, and what you do with it once it’s consumed? How can you <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/01/03/recommendations.html">curate your inputs</a> in a way that leans towards high-quality breadth?</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these methods are foolproof, but they point towards an enjoyable and rich intellectual lifestyle that doesn’t involve the sort of high-risk turmoil attached to pursuing expertise.</p>

It seems likely to me that pursuing expertise is overrepresented in career-advice-giving contexts, and that we should try to reframe <strong>not being an expert</strong> in a more positive light. We fetishise a very specific sort of expertise – A Beautiful Mind, 100-hours-a-week, obsessional expertise – as the gold standard for living meaningful intellectual lives. I’d like to suggest that there’s an alternative approach.</p>

<p>So here’s my reframing: more of us should try to be <strong>enthusiastic amateurs</strong>.</p>

<p>Firstly, as should be clear to anybody who interacts with me, I am not an expert at anything. And it’s quite possible that I’m telling this story to coddle my psyche; to bolster my self-confidence as I cling tightly to µ; to sit more readily on my averagely-comfortable chair, drinking Nescafé, as I type on my mid-range laptop with my average-sized hands. I will never have the temperament or talent to be world-class at anything, and I’d still like to be able to sleep at night.</p>

<p>However, I think the life of an enthusiastic amateur is not only a good one, but that cultivating it is also often the rational choice for somebody to make.</p>

<p>At the very least, the expertise norm is overrepresented, and that there’s value to be gained by exploring an alternative.</p>

<hr />

<p>Who are enthusiastic amateurs? Enthusiastic amateurs are people that work hard to see the world through as many lenses as possible. They care less about being great, and more about being good enough. They aspire to be polymaths, but recognise that <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/10/thoughts-on-peter-burkes-new-book-the-polymath.html">the definition is wanting</a>.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>How do they compare to experts? An expert is a hedgehog; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox">an enthusiastic amateur is a fox</a>. An expert relies on precision; an enthusiastic amateur relies on scope. An expert is tenacious; an enthusiastic amateur is mercurial. An expert toils; an enthusiastic amateur plays.</p>

<p>There are obvious trade-offs to chasing expertise, and the world obviously needs people willing to make those trade-offs (an enthusiastic amateur isn’t going to engineer a rocket good enough to get humans safely to Mars, although <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">one might build a company capable of doing so</a>). The trouble is, you don’t really know if you’ve got the capacity to be an expert at anything until you already are one. Mozart is the exception, not the rule. Unless you feel the gods have conspired to put you where you are, expertise is the sort of thing you need to work very, very hard to achieve.</p>

<p>From a position of uncertainty relative to one’s own abilities, then, deciding to pursue excellence <strong>in one thing</strong> seems like a risky strategy. You could chase expertise, drill, rinse, repeat. Develop slowly a garrison of discipline and knowledge and finely-honed tools for solving the more abstruse problems in your field. Learn deeply, and feel engaged in some sort of higher purpose; luxuriate in our <a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&amp;context=mapp_capstone">collective teleological hangover</a>.</p>

<p>That’s the success path. There’s a failure path too. You chase expertise, drill, rinse, repeat. You spend early mornings and late nights <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/07/how-i-practice-at-what-i-do.html">playing your scales</a>. You run up against your natural limits, and you don’t push past them. You continue to push, because you’re told <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau_effect">there are diminishing returns</a> and you need to keep working. But you never actually get past that point. You learn to work around your limitations in various ways in order to make this Sisyphean effort seem worthwhile, but you’re really just fooling yourself into thinking you’re getting more competent. Or, even if you are improving, you might never close the gap between you and your nearest competitor. There are a lot of dedicated, hard-working, decidedly non-expert people. There are far fewer who will meaningfully change their field.</p>

<p>You’re probably not going to become an expert. And if you’re probably not going to be an expert in the one or two things you care enough about in order to <strong>try</strong>, you’re more likely than not setting yourself up to fail. Failing can be a pretty unpleasant experience, and fighting through failure is so often a pyrrhic victory. Being irredeemably bad at something isn’t fun. This is an important psychological cost to factor in before you dedicate your life to something. (<a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/expected-value-theory/">Expected value theory</a> might be useful here: what’s the cost of failure multiplied by the probability that failure will happen? If you’re honest with yourself, it’s not likely that that number will be a ringing endorsement of pursuing expertise.)</p>

<p>As well as the psychological cost incurred when you wrap up your identity in a métier and then fail to live up to your own expectations, the pursuit of expertise has high <strong>opportunity costs</strong>, too: the costs incurred by not doing the other things that you could be doing while you pursue expertise. What you enjoy doing often changes, so if you spend the time becoming an expert, slogging over the plateau, it’s likely that you’ll miss out on a bunch of <strong>possible</strong> fun that you could have were your focus more elastic.</p>

<p>Another cost: I’m not convinced that there are <strong>always</strong> diminishing X-returns for X-ing[1], but there is a subset of Xs for which there are certainly diminishing <strong>social</strong> returns. You don’t need to be a Master of Wine to impress most dining companions: even if <strong>they</strong> are Masters of Wine, most other people are so far away from even passably knowledgeable about wine that a middling level of understanding can yield the majority of the benefits – the signalling power – that you can get from knowing about wine. In other words, you don’t need to be an expert to be impressive, even in the eyes of other experts.</p>

<p>If there are less obvious costs to being an expert, there are also less obvious benefits to being an enthusiastic amateur. It’s easy to underrate the benefits to being competent at a lot of things, especially when they’re compared to being excellent at one thing.</p>

<p>The world can often seem set up to reward experts more and reward enthusiastic amateurs less: academia seems to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna">1000-year experiment</a> to institutionalise this model. But such entrenched reward systems often offer the opportunity for arbitrage. Being <strong>good enough</strong> at lots of things means that you can often see connections between subjects that experts, siloed into their conceptual schemes, can’t.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Phillip Tetlock <a href="https://longnow.org/seminars/02007/jan/26/why-foxes-are-better-forecasters-than-hedgehogs/">argues that being a fox makes you, on average, a better predictor of the future</a>, for much the same reasons. Academia is famously siloed, but some of the best papers I’ve read are clever precisely because they apply techniques from one field to the problems of another. There is such a thing as gestalt knowledge, and I’d wager that enthusiastic amateurs are better at finding it than experts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there’s definitely some class of problems which require deep expertise to see and understand and solve. Some problems need smart people to sit and think very hard about for a long time. But I think we generally over-index on this sort of expertise, both institutionally (via the peer-review process) and in a more broad sense, culturally.</p>

<p>Being good enough has another interesting corollary: being good enough at a range of things creates interesting <strong>intersections at which you can be an expert</strong>. I might not be an expert programmer, or the world’s best philosopher, or the world’s foremost authority on wine or US politics or any of my other interests. But I’m probably in the top 1% of the general population at the <strong>intersection</strong> of those things, simply by virtue of the rarity of that intersection and my enthusiasm in pursuing them. By cultivating wider interests, and by getting good enough at a broad range of things, you can carve out interesting niches which give you both the ability to be world-leading in that niche and also emerge naturally from the explorations you make, rather than because of your dogged pursuit of decisions made a priori. In other words: being an enthusiastic amateur doesn’t mean you need to give up your edge. (As long as there are only a few enthusiastic amateurs, being an enthusiastic amateur might itself be an edge.) And, nowadays, <a href="https://substack.com/discover/category/crypto/paid">niches</a> <a href="https://substack.com/discover/category/sports/paid">can</a> <a href="https://substack.com/discover/category/climate/paid">pay</a>.</p>

<p>One of my smartest friends pointed out that the pursuit of enthusiastic amateurness is a very <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theoryofchange">Theory of Action</a>-driven thing. That is, it suggests answers to the question “what should I do next?” rather than “what should I do in order to achieve XYZ?”. He’s right, of course, but a priorly-formed want to achieve XYZ is the hallmark of a wannabe-expert, and therefore not per se the sort of thing that enthusiastic amateurs will be concerned with. The sort of long-term goals that Theories of Change point toward are often, at least at the subject-level<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, underspecified or weighed inappropriately in the more general calculation about how one should live one’s life.</p>

<p>The same friend also pointed out that <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/">advice is often written for the wrong people</a>, that being an enthusiastic amateur might also incur costs. One potential cost here: it might make it more challenging to signal your commitment to a group, and therefore make it more difficult to be embedded in a community of peers. He suggested for this reason that to the extent that one <strong>can</strong> choose their community, it’s better to be more specialised (and therefore expertise is rewarded proportionally). I don’t disagree. It might be. But presumably groups of enthusiastic amateurs – <a href="https://lesswrong.org">LessWrong</a>? <a href="https://interintellect.com">Interintellect</a>? – interested in how best they can be enthusiastic amateurs, exhibit the same sorts of dynamics. If you’re looking to signal your commitment to a group, “enthusiastic amateurs” might not be a bad group to join.</p>

<hr />

<p>Enthusiastic amateurs aren’t sloppy, or dismissive of expertise. The point is not to be bad at lots of things. It’s to recognise that expertise isn’t the end of the story, and that being good enough at a lot of stuff is often so much more rewarding than being really good at one thing. For many people, expertise is just out of acceptable reach. Whatever you’re good at, there is likely a Chinese toddler doing it better than you could ever hope to. Some people are born with the requisite interest and determination and tenacity to pursue excellence at one big thing. Many, many people are not. I’m pretty sure that a lot of what becoming an expert in something and sustaining that expertise is a slog, and that a lot of people don’t enjoy it as much as they think they should, and that their response to being uninspired is to accept being mediocre, and that this shouldn’t be where careers advice leads. As a result, I don’t think that traditional expertise-oriented career advice is especially good advice for the median person.</p>

<p>Being ‘good enough at X’ for many Xs is completely attainable and, I think, can often set you up to be rewarded socially and commercially. There are lots of people who should know, be emboldened by the fact that expertise is one way amongst several to slice the pie. You can have a rich and rewarding intellectual life without demanding of yourself that you know what you’re destined to do from an early age, or even be destined to do anything. That you can indulge your broader interests without it immediately being written off as procrastination. It’s also <strong>playful</strong>, in an earnest sense. For many, the life of an enthusiastic amateur is, I really, truly, believe, a lot more fun.</p>

      <p>I don’t, for instance, think that the piano-benefits to becoming an expert pianist diminish with more practice. As far as I can tell, being able to play a complicated piece marginally better does unlock new modes of expression and new value in the piece, and, moreover, that seems to happen proportionally to the amount of work you put in. <strong>Once you’re an expert</strong>, small variations can produce outsized results. This seems especially true in competitive zero-sum games that get repeated over time, like two tennis players facing off regularly. Relative to me, Federer’s marginal training session likely won’t change the outcome of our match. Relative to Nadal, it seems, that extra practice might make all the difference. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>I’m not quite sure about the meta-level. It might still make sense to pursue expertise at goal formation, or productivity, or something. Enthusiastic amateurs tend to be quite productive, relative to the mean. But maybe that’s because a lot of what they do is amongst the lower-hanging fruit, rather than because they’re productivity experts or aiming to be such. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

I also receive a fair few.</p>

<p>Unless the facts change from out under my feet – one day I’ll tell you a story about The Marksman – I think my recommendations are generally pretty good. But I would, wouldn’t I? Unless I don’t like you, I’m not going to recommend things I don’t think are good recommendations.</p>

<p>It’s very important to be careful when recommending. If you eat out often, say ~3 times / week, you can expect to have ~9,300 meals over a 60-year adulthood of eating. That isn’t many meals! I read roughly a book per week. That’s ~3,120 books in the same adulthood. That isn’t many books! So each meal and each book has to count. &amp; many people eat out many fewer times per month and read much less. Centrally: you should respect the time and money that people will spend based on your recommendations.</p>

<p>It’s also easier to recommend things in the indirect-objectless sense, as I do in the restaurant list above. But recommendations are often recommendations <em>to</em> somebody, in some context, for some purpose.</p>

<p>In these cases, how should we tell which recommendations to listen to, and which to ignore? How reliable is the average recommendation? How can you reliably make good recommendations to others?</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, there are obvious heuristics we can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prior experience of the recommender’s recommendations</strong>. Have you been to restaurants with this person before? Did you like the last movie she recommended?</li>
  <li><strong>The recommender’s knowledge of the subject matter</strong>. Is he an expert? Are they at least an enthusiastic amateur? Are you confident they know a lot about this?</li>
  <li><strong>The recommender’s knowledge of the recommendee’s tastes</strong>. Does this person know you? Do you have confidence in her model of your preferences? Does he buy you good novels at Christmas?</li>
  <li><strong>Consensus amongst more than one recommender</strong>. Have you heard from multiple people that this restaurant is good? Have each of them been consistent in their reasons for recommending it, or have the different reasons been intriguing and appealing?</li>
</ul>

<p>These each seem non-controversially true: if these conditions are met, it seems more likely that you’ll get a good recommendation. But it’s not at all obvious to me that you’ll <em>reliably</em> (i.e. &gt;50% of the time) get a good recommendation.</p>

<p>For one thing, the facts can change from out under the feet of the recommender. In a large city like London, you’re not likely to revisit the same restaurant more than a few times a month (unless it’s provenly reliable and local). Staff turns over, the great old chef moves to her new place, your friend goes on a busy night, has horrible service, and it’s game over.</p>

<p>For another, it’s only semi-plausible that good taste clusters. So if the recommender’s taste in novels is good, that doesn’t on the face of it seem to suggest his taste in restaurants will necessarily be good; or art, or music, or whatever else. Some people seem blessed with good taste across the board, but that’s far from true universally.</p>

<p>For a third – and this is my central point here – contexts which involve taste exhibit huge interpersonal variation <em>no matter how persuasive the a priori justification happens to be</em>.</p>

<p>So what are some things we can do to ensure we receive better recommendations, and can filter out the bad ones that slip through?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Surround yourself by people with good taste.</strong> This seems like an easy one, but something I think not enough people act on meaningfully. It’s worth selecting good taste into your friendship group, not just because the quality of the recommendations you’ll receive will increase, but because you’ll develop a better appreciation for <em>what sorts of people are the sorts of people who make good recommendations</em>, which of course generalises.</li>
  <li><strong>Cultivate better taste yourself; learn more</strong>. Another easy one too easily forgotten. Do you reflect on your aesthetic experiences, note what you enjoyed and what you didn’t? Do you move outside of your comfort zone frequently, and take the hits (so your recommendees don’t have to?) Do you make an active and regular effort to learn more?<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Select for order-of-magnitude differences.</strong> You should aim to find recommenders who have at least an order-of-magnitude more experience than you, and try to tailor your recommendations to people with at least an order-of-magnitude less. There’s enough noise so that the marginal next % of exposure seems much less important. I wouldn’t, for instance, trust the judgement of somebody who had been to strictly <em>one</em> more opera than me. (This perhaps isn’t the case if I’ve <em>never</em>  been to an opera.) Another reason why a little learning is a dangerous thing.</li>
  <li><strong>Go wide then deep then wide again.</strong> A good way to think about taste is effective pattern-matching. For this you first need a broad range of knowledge to anchor novel experiences, and then enough depth of understanding to discriminate between the great and merely good. But it’s important to back out of the rabbit hole and dig yourself another one. Eat fifteen different cuisines, then pick a few and learn the regional variances within them, then eat fifteen more.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Consider the incentives.</strong> Tyler Cowen’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/six-rules-for-dining-out/308929/">famous piece</a> on restaurant recommendations makes this point well. If a restaurant is full of good-looking people, it will attract more people, holding fixed the quality of the food, which reduces the incentive for the restaurant to care about the food as much. (The restaurant, in effect, stops competing on quality of food and thus stops caring about it.) These sorts of incentives are everywhere, and it’s both fun and useful to be a little cynical and consider how they might affect your experience, and the recommendations you receive and make on the basis of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two final points to consider. Firstly, perhaps try to elicit and make <em>anti-recommendations</em> rather than positive recommendations. It can often be more helpful to know <em>where to avoid</em> rather than where to go. This seems a little counterintuitive, since we’re optimising for the positive case – i.e. the case in which we in fact do go to the restaurant – but it’s useful because it provides useful information and still ‘frees up’ the higher end of the recommendation spectrum to float more independently. Similar concerns apply to groups of positive recommendations (“eat in Shoreditch”, “read novels from feminist authors in the 1920s”). You can then use your good taste to narrow it down further.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, try to keep an open mind, and give others as many opportunities to be open-minded as possible. (If that means hiding certain things from your recommendees, so be it.) This can be very high-leverage, because the best sort of recommendation (at least in an information-theoretic sense) is the recommendation somebody is unlikely to receive from anybody else. For instance, many people miss out on amazing food because they dislike the <em>idea</em> of offal, while at the same time are fine with a chicken liver pâté. It’s not that they won’t like offal, it’s that they’re unlikely to follow a recommendation that mentions it, and therefore people are unlikely to make these recommendations in the first place. Sometimes it takes a bit of energy to get past the inertial resistance.</p>

<p>My mother hates the idea of lardo, but couldn’t stop eating the lardo-fried rice at Smoking Goat. I may have forgotten to tell her what it was.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s important to acknowledge that the grass is greener, because, well it is. Sometimes you’re not in the best possible timeline, and bringing it to your own attention is the first step toward changing it.</p>

<p>But it’s often unhelpful, too, and can trap you into a cycle of distraction and dissatisfaction. You change something, because the grass over there is greener, and you reinforce the preferences you have for novelty. The less you develop the ability to stick with something, focus, persevere, the more difficult it becomes the next time you must.</p>

<p>The more vulnerable you become to your own whims.</p>

<p>The more often you throw away something valuable, because you’re suffering under some sort of novelty bias and what appears to be objectively better is simply fresher.</p>

<p>So it can be useful to reframe how you view your current situation. When I regret some decision because the alternative looks easier, or if I suspect I have made a mistake, I can find solace in the knowledge that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It can be easy to forget you’re making trade-offs explicitly and knowingly;</li>
  <li>and, the <strong>tradeoffs are generally worth it</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The beginning of anything requires a first step. A new job, a new purchase, a new skill or hobby, a new relationship. If you’re a thoughtful and goal-oriented person, you will consider whether this the right step for you. Something that might appear to be obvious at the time might be a mistake later, and you know this, so you take your time, weigh up your options. Consider the pros and cons and decide to act.</p>

<p>The next day, you’re in the honeymoon phase. The cons are irrelevant. The pros are even better than you expected. You enjoy the present. You look forward to the future with anticipation, with giddiness, with glee.</p>

<p>Some days later, the pros and cons look evenly balanced. You’re less interested than you once were, but stasis is a powerful force, so you do nothing about it.</p>

<p>Some days further, the cons are now what is salient. What began as small pet peeves or niggling doubts have blossomed. The cons are so overwhelming, so frustrating, that you cannot imagine why you could ever have thought the pros might outweigh them (or, hell, even counterbalance them!)</p>

<p>What seemed like a good idea now looks like a set of inappropriate, naïve preferences borne from the brain of somebody <strong>who knew less than what you do now</strong>.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing. You made those tradeoffs. You considered the pros, you considered the cons.</p>

<p>You might have missed some of the cons initially; not everybody gets it right first time. But this also applies to the pros. Are there not things about your role, your club, your partner, your commitment, whatever it is, that are unexpectedly pleasant, as well as unexpectedly not-so?</p>

<p>If it appears not, then consider this: even if you were able to predict everything a priori, do you think you’d be weighing the cons and pros appropriately after the cons have become so aggravating that you felt the need to reweigh them in the first place?</p>

<p>People only really reflect on whether their decisions were correct when they have reason to suspect that they weren’t.</p>

<p>People don’t look to upend the boat when they’re enjoying the journey.</p>

<p>So your re-evaluation may be happening from a place of more intimate knowledge, but it’s also happening from a place of discomfort.</p>

<p>There are definitely times when you should re-evaluate. When you are being harmed. When you have good reason to suspect you misjudged it all initially. Or when your preferences have changed significantly since then.</p>

<p>But there are lots of times when you shouldn’t. When, were you to reflect in a pro-dominant phase, you’d conclude quite differently.</p>

<p>The grass is always greener, Jamie.</p>

<p>The tradeoffs are usually worth it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="productivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m very prone to greener-grass thinking.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Books I Wish Existed</title><link href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2021/05/16/books-i-wish-existed.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Books I Wish Existed" /><published>2021-05-16T16:16:37+01:00</published><updated>2021-05-16T16:16:37+01:00</updated><id>https://jamieonsoftware.com/2021/05/16/books-i-wish-existed</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2021/05/16/books-i-wish-existed.html"><![CDATA[<p>For a while I’ve been collecting a list of interesting book-length projects. Since I’m never going to write the bloody things, I figured it’d be better to throw them into the light of day and see what daylight makes of them.
Here is a preliminary, first stab at a list of books I wish existed: books that haven’t been written yet, but could be.</p>

<p><strong>A collection of short books on the history and interpretation of U.S. constitutional amendments</strong></p>

<p>One under-explored feature of the US constitution is its deep cultural, as well as judicial, role in modern American politics. Each amendment has its own motivations, historical context, and judicial precedent; but each amendment also serves as the starting point for contemporary arguments for or against certain policies: even, today, <a href="https://theconversation.com/im-a-first-amendment-scholar-and-i-think-big-tech-should-be-left-alone-153287">the policies of private companies</a>.</p>

<p>I’d like to see a series of short, concise, focussed books – think roughly the length and depth of the <a href="https://www.veryshortintroductions.com/">OUP Very Short Introductions</a> series – with each volume focussed around an amendment to the U.S. constitution. Each book could discuss the amendment’s historical context, important cases in its subsequent judicial precedent, and the moral and legal and institutional justifications for the amendment and how they have changed.</p>

<p>Most amendments would have their own volume, while some of the more arcane amendments might be bundled together, where appropriate. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">18th &amp; 21st</a> are a natural pairing; the 13th, 14th and 15th sit snugly together in terms of their shared historical context, but are perhaps each significant enough, with their own rich set of continuing precedent and relevance, for their own volumes; perhaps the 3rd, 4th and 5th. It might also be interesting to conclude the series with a volume on the amendments that didn’t get passed: amongst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proposed_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution">many others</a>, the ERA, balanced budget amendments, the We the People amendment.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing Like A Startup</strong></p>

<p>Scott’s <em>Seeing Like A State</em> is an excellent piece of political epistemology, not because he makes a powerful moral argument to curtail the absolute power of the state – which he does – nor because of the trenchant analysis he applies to the material and sociopolitical conditions under which the tools of statecraft are likely to be abused – which he gives – but because it grounds the analysis in a <em>Weltanschauung</em>, an all-encompassing frame of reference, a set of spectacles that underpin the identity of those who wear them. To see like a state is not just to see the world a certain way, to plan with a specific framework, to write with a specific dictionary, but also to <em>be</em> somebody.</p>

<p>Isn’t the same true of startup-land? Isn’t working in a startup with its techno-optimism and its studied disregard of conventional wisdom and Disruption with a Capital D a form of world-view? Weren’t we decades ahead on remote work and Agile / Lean Startup approaches to product development? Don’t startups, especially tech startups, have a distinctive set of incentives and respond to a distinctive set of internal and external cues? Isn’t this weird (physical or virtual) Bay Area we inhabit a conduit for a specific mode of thought, a Weltanschauung, a pair of spectacles?</p>

<p><strong>A full-length biography of Évariste Galois</strong></p>

<p>Évariste Galois died aged 20, after being shot in the stomach with a pistol. He died a gregarious yet unlikable, angry young man, but he bequeathed us a small elliptic body of mathematical work that has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory">proven</a> to be incredibly fertile.</p>

<p>The short biographies that accompany discussions of his work are useful and evocative, but focus almost exclusively on either his precociousness, or the Potemkin-romanticism of his death. His life was short but full of activity, sadness, anger, intense adolescence, mental illness and revolutionary politics.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evariste-Galois-fabrication-ic%C3%B4ne-math%C3%A9matique/dp/2713223172">best biography of him so far (fr)</a> focusses on Galois-as-mathematical-figure (‘personne’ vs ‘personnage’). I’d like to see a full-length biography of Galois-as-boy and Galois-as-man, as well as Galois-as-mathematician: something that draws out the dynamics of a Republican and Bonapartite household in restoration Paris, the stability of his mother and bipolarity of his father (who himself committed suicide when Évariste was 15), the friends and foes, real and imagined, that shaped this troubled young boy.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to write this book for a while, but have <a href="http://jamierumbelow.net/paused.html">put the project on hold</a>. Perhaps I’ll resurrect it one day.</p>

<p><strong>Uses and abuses of popular science</strong></p>

<p>The effective communication of science is incredibly important. What the electorate understands and values about scientific output can translate meaningfully into policy outcomes, on the one hand, and our continued ability to discover more about the world on the other. (At its limit, it can cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Commission_Report">deadly incentives failures</a> when the scientific bureaucracy needs to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher_in_Space_Project">reengage a science-saturated public</a>).  Simplifying without talking down is a tough job, and the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"> very</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00AQLFQKW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">best</a><a href="https://timharford.com/"> writers</a> do it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould">elegance</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter">wit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Sacks">humanity</a>. But so much of it is reductionist, factually incorrect, statistically ignorant, sensationalist drivel.</p>

<p>Writing about science poorly harms us all. Being excessively confident about scientists’ predictions – “toast causes cancer!” – shifts our focus onto the wrong things, or erodes trust in the output of science when it turns out that, you know, the world might be a little more complicated. Being excessively cynical about science’s output is so often a tiresome postmodern ploy to import political solutions to yet-understood social issues.</p>

<p>I’d like to see a book on popular science and the popularisation of science: what good it can do when it’s good, what harm it can do when it’s bad, and how we can get more of the former and less of the latter. I’d also like to learn more about how science fiction fits into all this. We will never get to a stage where science is not weaponised in one direction or another – discovery is, as the physicists of the Manhattan Project discovered, the beginning of the moral story, not the end of it – but with a better understanding of how science is reported, we might be able to give people the tools to at least discount the views of the most egregious of offenders.</p>

<p><strong>What <em>could</em> science look like?</strong></p>

<p>The way that modern science is structured – the categories and classifications of physics, biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, philosophy, the social sciences – forms a reasonably arbitrary and path-dependent structure. A few changes in how humans organised themselves at various stages, how projects got funded, and which questions happened to be salient (for cultural or contingent material reasons), and we have a very different body of knowledge, structured along different lines, today. What, for instance, would modern AI look like if the centre of gravity in computer science hadn’t drifted away from cybernetics and the HCI-focussed research tradition during the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop/dp/1732265119">ARPA golden years</a>, and toward applied mathematics and algorithm design? What could biology look like if our best mathematicians were more interested in biological systems rather than physical systems? What would Newton have done if he hadn’t spent so much time pursuing alchemy?</p>

<p><strong>A good moral, economic and psychological investigation into paternalism.</strong></p>

<p>I have a set of libertarian-ish (which is to say, mostly negative) aesthetic reactions to paternalism, and, in a trivial sense, ‘paternalism is bad’ seems true by definition – at least on a normative reading of ‘paternalism’. Naturally, these intuitions have come into much sharper focus throughout the pandemic. But state interventions in private lives are nothing new, in many cases they are basically uncontroversial (e.g. seat belts) and there are a whole host of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paternalism/">moral</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947001">economic</a> arguments in favour as well as against.</p>

<p>Perhaps paternalistic reasoning is our default mode of thought and respect for individual freedom only gets bolted on in certain contexts? If you really believe that such-and-such a lifestyle is immoral, harmful materially and spiritually to he who practices it, why wouldn’t you want to intervene? Liberalism is a position most have to contort themselves into.
I’d like to see a modern book-length treatment of this subject, exploring the changing relationship between individual and society, ideally within a framework that make sense of big data, the long death of privacy, and crypto- or techno-libertarianism.</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetics in politics.</strong></p>

<p>Hume never got to finish his <a href="https://davidhume.org/texts/t/ad1739">‘examination of morals, politics, and criticism’</a>, but if he had, I imagine much of the project would be spent grounding political discourse in terms of human sentiments like approval and disgust. Jonathan Haidt offers <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0141039167">a modern-day version of this story</a>, arguing for the centrality of psychological states in understanding politics and religious discourse.</p>

<p>But one thing that often gets ignored, I think, is how much <em>aesthetics</em> play a part. People find views they dislike not just disagreeable but <em>ugly</em>, and often detached logical reasoning takes a backseat to matters of taste. I’d wager that a lot of opposition to virtue signalling, for instance, is simply that it seems distasteful, or uncouth, or something like that.</p>

<p>To what extent do we elevate matters of taste to matters of shared social importance? (There’s an interesting Twitter thread <a href="https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1350300376205938688?s=24">here</a> on conservatism and aesthetic sense, which might begin to address these issues.)</p>

<p><strong>The House of Uncommons: the rise and fall of excellence in politics</strong></p>

<p>Why has politics lost its cultural cachet? Why do we pay our governors so little relative to other, <a href="https://dollarsandsense.sg/heres-much-singapores-president-cabinet-ministers-paid-salary/">arguably better run</a>, countries – and certainly less than a lot of private-sector high-status jobs? Are our politicians getting more incompetent and panderous, as they do indeed seem to be? When was the golden era of the politician? What characteristics should we try to select for? Given the unpredictability of democracy and the epistemic credentials of the average voter, how can we reshape our institutions to better encourage the selection of these characteristics?</p>

<p><strong>The Aesthetics of Programming Languages</strong></p>

<p>One thing that often gets lost amongst the computer science jargon and expediencies of writing functional software is that there’s an important <em>aesthetic</em> dimension to programming, a concern with the beauty of the code and algorithms we write. We throw around words like ‘beautiful’ when we talk about code, but we’re usually just gesturing toward some muddy intuitive notion, something like ‘clean’. There’s been little attempt to define these words more rigorously, or explore other aesthetic or aesthetic-adjacent virtues, such as simplicity, or parsimony.</p>

<p>It’s not merely syntactic, either. Much of what a programmer does is invent abstractions, extract out pieces of a system into reusable and more generic chunks. Some abstractions are intuitively better than others. But on what grounds? It’s not just “how widely applicable is this thing”, or “how performant is this thing”, or “how few lines of code does this thing take to implement or call”. There’s a notion of <em>expressivity</em>, the capacity for the abstraction to open and close the right set of logical doors, that is crucially important, and, crucially, misunderstood.</p>

<p>It runs deeper than just the code that actually gets written. Different language design decisions force us to <em>think</em> about our code in different ways, and to structure our programmes along different fault lines. Type systems force us to think about our domain before we think about the processes we apply in that domain. Pure functional languages force us to think about the flow and transformation of data. Different languages, sometimes, though by no means always, designed for different tasks, start with different mental primitives which change both how we write code now, and how the norms of the broader language ecosystem evolve.</p>

<p>The great irony of programming: instructing computers can be a deeply human thing. It would be fun to see a thoughtful little book exploring these questions in more detail.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="books" /><category term="politics" /><category term="startups" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a while I’ve been collecting a list of interesting book-length projects.

<p>Plaid provide an abstraction around bank accounts. They offer a developer-friendly API to query one or more of a user’s accounts. This allows startups and consumer products to offer financial analysis and services in a bank-agnostic way.</p>

<p>On the back of this purchase, and alongside my general growing interest in fintech, I’ve been becoming more and more bullish about Visa.</p>

<p>But why did Visa pay <em>so much</em> for Plaid?</p>

<p>$5.3b is a <em>lot</em> of money. It’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2020/01/13/why-visa-is-buying-fintech-startup-plaid-for-53-billion">somewhere between a 25x and 50x multiple of Plaid’s revenue</a>.</p>

<p>The Plaid team are impressive, but at $5.3b, it’s got to be something strategic. As <a href="https://twitter.com/ricburton">my friend Rich</a> put it, when you’re counting in billions, it’s not an acquihire.</p>

<p>So if it’s not revenue, and it’s not (just) the team, what’s the strategic value in Visa’s owning Plaid?</p>

<p>I can think of three big reasons:</p>

<p><strong>1. It solidifies Visa’s core business.</strong></p>

<p>Visa is a three-sided network. It provides the infrastructure to move money between consumers, merchants, and banks.</p>

<p>When Visa works well, everyone benefits:</p>

<p>Consumers get instant access to credit, and can buy products from anywhere the card is supported.</p>

<p>Merchants can accept payments from anyone, and no longer need to run back-office operations responsible for credit and payments, nor handle cash.</p>

<p>Banks can offer credit to consumers more easily, at higher interest rates, and collect fees from merchants to provide the aforementioned credit management services – and, in doing so, reduce merchants’ exposure to credit risk.</p>

<p>For arranging this service, Visa charge merchants and banks a percentage of each transaction. The <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/V?p=V">underlying economics of the business</a> are excellent: they have over a 50% profit margin, steady revenues, a long pedigree, and revenue still grows 10% year-on-year.</p>

<p>Plaid can contribute to this core business, since an increase in fintech innovation is likely to increase transactions simpliciter:</p>

<p>Banks can offer more, and better tailored, financial products to consumers. Visa can better integrate identity and security services with payments, reducing rates of fraud. More broadly, and more importantly, fintech <a href="https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/fintech-for-all/">can, and will, bring finance to the under- and unbanked</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, Visa can leverage Plaid to shore up the existing network, make being a Visa customer more attractive, and create whole new demographics of customers in developing markets.</p>

<p>All of this means more transactions, and more transactions means more transaction fees.</p>

<p><strong>2. Plaid is a good business in its own right.</strong></p>

<p>A 25x to 30x multiple on revenue is large, but Plaid are still a relatively young company.</p>

<p>Plaid offers Visa the opportunity to take fees from the “other side” of the consumer’s relationship with the bank: in GraphQL terms, the <em>queries</em> against the bank account rather than the <em>mutations</em> on it. This is somewhere Visa currently aren’t able to capture value.</p>

<p>Plaid’s target customers are software engineers, but the institutions at the bottleneck to Plaid’s growth are banks. Now Plaid has the weight – and half-century of personal relationships – of Visa behind it, the product itself can grow substantially more.</p>

<p>Plaid are also, so far, focussed heavily on the U.S. Fintech opportunities are global, so now Plaid can lean on Visa’s global reach to expand internationally.</p>

<p>All this said, Plaid could represent a significant income stream for Visa in its own right.</p>

<p><strong>3. Plaid is part of a broader Cambrian explosion in fintech.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, this purchase reflects a wider trend.</p>

<p>As Stripe, Twilio, Algolia, and now Plaid have shown, making developers happy is big business.</p>

<p>But making developers happy and productive also has serious downstream effects. It reduces the amount of time and money it takes to create new products. It encourages the development of new tools which themselves make developers happy and productive, effecting a <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-open-source-decade-fueled-by-cloud-and-github/">Cambrian explosion</a> of new products and tools.</p>

<p>Just like the set of norms and tools developed around open source, and <a href="https://medium.com/dappradar-com/collateralization-and-composability-what-i-learned-at-defi-summit-london-2019-446005eee000">composability</a> in smart-contract technologies, making it easy, cheap, and secure for developers to access financial data will only accelerate the potential of technology –– and, crucially, along dimensions we can’t easily predict.</p>

<p>In short: it increases the amount of innovation possible in the world.</p>

<p>If I am at all correct about this, then Visa have shorn up their excellent business model, giving themselves access to an attractive new revenue stream, and now control a resource which has already, and will continue to be, central to sustaining and growing the fintech space, and, eventually, the global economy.</p>

Sometimes our fiddling was productive, clearing emails, writing lists, researching some topic or other – but most of the time, it wasn’t.</p>

<p>And it’s easy to justify it to yourself if it’s AngelList, or LinkedIn: you’re keeping up with career options. Hacker News is obviously of great professional concern to a software engineer. Twitter keeps you wired into the zeitgeist. And, as for Facebook, what could be more important than friends and family?</p>

<p>The point, of course, is that I’m fickle and distractible and the only thing that can salvage my mornings, whittle and form them out of the chaos, is to leave the matter out of my hands entirely. Leave motivation and bandwidth in the hands of a /system/, and make delivery an inevitability – or at least a reliable expectation – rather than something subject to whimsy and caprice.</p>

<p>So we built a system, and we call it “book hour”. Every morning, we read, at least, a few pages of a dead-trees paper book. Before touching our phone.</p>

<p>A glimpse of analog before our days become digital.</p>

<p>You can turn off your alarm. If somebody calls you, you’re allowed to answer. And it’s flexible: if you both agree on an exemption – early start, late start, got to catch a flight, etc. – then it’s allowed.</p>

<p>But it turns out that we rarely need an exemption, because beginning your day with a few pages of a book is actually a really nice thing to do.</p>

<p>So, incentives:</p>

<p>Carrot: you end up reading more, and, in a relaxed and controlled manner, gradually phase into your day.</p>

<p>Stick: If you touch your phone before reading a few pages, £10 goes in a savings pot in our joint bank account. When the pot reaches some amount, we take ourselves out for dinner.</p>

<p>This is good because it serves the psychological function of an incentive without any great real-terms material loss (we’d probably spend the money on eating out anyway.) It hurts without hurting.</p>

<p>It’s effective, and I urge you to try it out if you too are looking for an easy and fun way to cut down on screen-time.</p>

<p>It’s also, I think, illustrative of a more general approach to productivity, good work, and human happiness:</p>

<p>Build systems that minimise friction, and, where appropriate, align your incentives with your interests.</p>

<p>Research is chaotic, but it’s okay, because we can build routines which encourage regular, structured work and limit the possibility of procrastination.</p>

<p>Memory is chaotic, but it’s okay, because we can use spaced-repetition to minimise friction and <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">make long-term memory a choice</a>. (As for incentives: how about an Anki hour?)</p>

<p>The shape and structure of data is chaotic, but it’s okay, because we can work with statically typed languages and write unit tests, both of which have all kinds of good upstream effects.</p>

<p>The world is chaotic, but it’s okay, because systems help tame it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="productivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago, J and I noticed we’d lie in bed, fiddling with our phones for 30, 40, 45 minutes, an hour, many, most mornings, every morning.

<p>Most political ideologies have clear theoretical commitments. Liberalism: the individual as the primitive unit of society; his wellbeing subordinate to, or exhausted by, his freedom; doctrines of rights which circumscribe and define that freedom sitting at the base of any institutional arrangements. Socialism: the collective as the primitive; the individual’s wants subordinate to the group’s needs; a commitment to equality expressed in the common ownership of property.</p>

<p>But anarchism doesn’t really seem to fit. Anarchism, it seems to me, isn’t a political ideology at all: it’s more like a family resemblance, each anarchism approximating the others to a greater or lesser degree, but none admitting of a common core or shared basis. A fluid set of concepts aimed at achieving a form of radical egalitarianism rather than a concrete theory. Or perhaps, like conservatism, it’s more of a temperament, an inclination to gesture toward an outcome, rather than an explicit set of instructions to achieve it.</p>

<p>‘Anti-capitalist egalitarianism’ holds the clue to unlocking it, says Kinna. But ‘anti-capitalist egalitarianism’ is hardly a clearer term than ‘anarchism’.</p>

<p>In one direction, it veers into a Kantian metaphysical liberalism of totally self-regulating agents. In another, it seems to collapse into communism. So the exponent of anarchism as <em>a distinctive tradition</em> must not only explain anarchism on its own terms, but also situate it relative to the primitives of both the liberal and communist traditions, without relying on the primitives of either.</p>

<p>It turns out that such a tradition can be cleaved out from between the two extremes. But it’s awfully difficult to do cleanly.</p>

<p>Kinna does well to reveal anarchism’s parallel world of literature, art and debate. And she does a good job at casting the anarchist in a positive light, of repainting the out of the colours of a psychotic lover-of-chaos and into something a little more.</p>

<p>But it’s not a good book.</p>

<p>One problem is Kinna’s bias, and how it can hinder the book’s analytical power. This is advertised as a “sympathetic account”, and, to that extent, it delivers: she clearly has an affinity with the anarchist programme and is deeply immersed in its literature. But that’s also what makes it a tough book to follow: her familiarity means that she never really explains the basics, leaving the rest of us to reconstruct the edifice on which her explanations sit.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This lack of an accessible introduction means that, to the outsider, it is a book of half-thoughts, non-sequiturs and passages groaning under the weight of technical terminology:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rejection of domination unifies anarchists in shared struggles against the monopolization of resources and the centralization of power, representation, racism, imperialism and authority, while leaving the institutional and sociological mechanisms that explain it open to discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Passages like the above are littered throughout the book, and yet the core concepts they turn on are never really explained. Is domination just shorthand for the ‘monopolization of resources and the centralization of power’? If not, what is it? And if so, why isn’t that compatible with federalism and some liberal anti-trust laws? Isn’t the <em>point</em> of representation to centralise power? And what does it mean to centralise racism and imperalism? Why is authority a bad thing, its centralisation to be struggled against; doesn’t its goodness follow analytically?</p>

<p>And why couldn’t it be that these institutional and sociological mechanisms justify, not just explain the phenomena? Why accept these normative claims in the first place? Answers are not forthcoming, and so the whole thing feels incoherent, and in-groupy.</p>

<p>It is at its most incoherent and in-groupy in the section on education. Education is an important piece of the anarchist puzzle, since most people are in fact decidedly <em>not</em> anarchists, and the political organisation it proposes requires individuals thinking and acting freely in anarchistic (i.e. egalitarian, ‘non-dominating’) ways. But anarchist thought on education, beyond just rehashing Marxist ideas about power sustaining power through ideology, are deeply unenlightening:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowledge is underpinned by linear, instrumental reasoning and this is manipulative and alienating … Education … comes, instead, through re-wilding: reconnecting to undomesticated, genuinely ecological and gentler systems of knowing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so it goes on, and on, and on.</p>

<p>Inaccessibility is this book’s original sin, but it also feels like it’s been rushed to print. Structurally, it’s organised thematically (Traditions, Cultures, Practices, Conditions, Prospects; followed by a set of anarchist biographies, which is mostly filler) and yet it focusses much on the historical development of the ideas, with the result that it keeps jolting, restarting; awkwardly lapsing into chronology, bumping against the ostensible thematic structure. Each insight and thinker tumbles into the next, presenting a cacophony of anarchisms, rather than a single unified theory. All of which means there’s little to no sustained argumentation.</p>

<p>The biggest sin, however, is the lack of a genuine multi-sided discussion of political violence. Government actions are described as “horrifying brutality and evident injustice”; anarchist assassinations and violent direct action are described in much cooler, theoretical terms. Her sympathy means we miss any real discussion of these very important questions: the extent to which political violence is legitimate, necessary or just. And while I understand her reluctance to encourage the typical framing of anarchism as chaos, violence and disorder, violence is anarchism’s shibboleth, and any book on the subject ought to address it.</p>

<p>Instead of a subtle, informed, nuanced debate of both why <em>these given thinkers</em> find it legitimate, and under what conditions <em>we</em> might today, we get quiet acquiescence, defensiveness, deflection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One example of this is the debate about the ‘black bloc’ – the protest tactic associated with politic confrontation. Another is tactical diversity … resonant with the fluidity of historical anarchist activism, [which] encourages activists to ask whether a proposed action is ‘effective at generating power’ rather than ask whether it is ‘peaceful or violent’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s as close as we get to a discussion of this central issue, and it’s a much poorer book because of it.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of content in here. Kinna knows the tradition well. And it may be a valuable reference for somebody already au fait with the anarchist tradition; someone already predisposed to buy what it’s selling. But that’s not me.</p>

    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Some of the main concepts – domination, power, self-emancipation – echo Marx, but seem to be used in a different way; anarchism doesn’t share Marxism’s explanatory basis of historical materialism. Kinna never really explains what anarchists mean by these concepts, perhaps because they’re used so variously that there isn’t any common definition to give. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

And while it’s often a little <em>too</em> political, too much on its sleeve – which hinders the analytical power of some of the more polemical pieces – I was a happy subscriber for years and recommend it to anybody.</p>

<p>For the next month, <a href="https://lrb.co.uk">the website’s paywall will be down</a> and everything will be free. I figured I’d use this opportunity to link to a few pieces that I’ve read, enjoyed, not forgotten, or otherwise found interesting.</p>

<p>You could start with <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v20/n23/christopher-hitchens/moderation-or-death">Hitchens on Ignatieff on Berlin</a>, Meany on <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n03/thomas-meaney/the-hagiography-factory">Schlesinger Jr.</a>, or <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v06/n10/bernard-williams/personal-identity">Williams on Parfitt</a>. Two pieces by the philosopher Amia Srinivasan, one <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n17/amia-srinivasan/the-sucker-the-sucker">on octopodes and consciousness</a>, the other <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n06/amia-srinivasan/does-anyone-have-the-right-to-sex">on politics and sexual desire</a> are insightful and elegant. Jeremy Waldron, as ever, writes extraordinarily well <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n17/jeremy-waldron/quibbling-wrangling">on the shape and character of a politics given by a country’s constitution</a>, and the tradeoffs (tradesoff?) involved.</p>

<p>David Runciman is a regular contributor, and always interesting: <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n19/david-runciman/his-fucking-referendum">on David Cameron and the 2016 referendum</a>; <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n12/david-runciman/steely-women-in-a-world-of-wobbly-men">on Theresa May</a>; <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n19/david-runciman/i-didn-t-do-anything-wrong-in-the-first-place">on Trump</a>; <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n15/david-runciman/the-impermanence-of-importance">on Obama</a>; <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n01/david-runciman/what-was-it-that-drove-him">on Gordon Brown</a>; and <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n02/david-runciman/diary">on artificial intelligence</a>. Jonathan Rée wrote <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n24/jonathan-ree/in-such-a-labyrinth">on James Harris’s Hume</a>, and <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n06/jonathan-ree/horrible-heresies">on Edwin Curley’s Spinoza</a>. I’ve enjoyed articles <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n09/adam-shatz/out-of-sight-out-of-mind">on punishment and race in America</a>, <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v38/n15/stephen-sedley/resistance-to-torpor">on Entick v. Carrington</a>, and Geoffrey Hawthorn’s <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n13/geoffrey-hawthorn/what-philosophers-dream-of">reflections on my favourite philosopher, Bernard Williams</a>.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n01/neve-gordon/the-new-anti-semitism">three</a> <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n09/stephen-sedley/defining-anti-semitism">interesting</a> <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v25/n16/judith-butler/no-it-s-not-anti-semitic">pieces</a> on antisemitism, zionism, Israel, its government, and the relations between all of the above; though none, in my opinion, quite understand the relevant problems, or render with enough subtlty the range of opinions amongst diasporic Jews –– and the dangers of getting the answers wrong. (Relatedly, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev8kxj/how-labour-could-start-to-solve-its-anti-semitism-crisis">Ido Vock’s piece in Vice</a> is the best article on this subject that I’ve ever read.)</p>

<p>The LRB occasionally jumps to and revives older texts, like <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n01/michael-wood/don-t-worry-about-the-pronouns">this review of my favourite Iris Murdoch novel, Under The Net</a>. And sometimes <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n16/patrick-cockburn/endtimes-in-mosul">it doesn’t review texts at all, but instead tells contemporary people’s stories</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the blogs, which always remain free, are also worth exploring. There’s a piece on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2019/january/academic-freedom">Finnis, homosexuality, and academic freedom</a> by Sophie Smith, which helped me see into a blind spot of my liberalism. Or there’s this piece on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2018/september/landmines-in-the-sahara">Landmines in the Sahara</a> by an old acquaintance of mine, Matthew Porges; his piece on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/july/killing-a-camel">Killing a Camel</a> is also good. Srinivasan also wrote <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/january/remembering-derek-parfit">a short obituary on Parfitt, which is charming</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="books" /><category term="politics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The London Review of Books has been a good companion to me, its prose crisp and clean and sometimes lyrical, its horizons broad.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Why is everybody so surprised that so many working-class Northern seats went Tory? The moment Labour prevaricated over their Brexit position was the moment they lost these seats. Delivering Brexit matters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an empirical point I’ve not tested, but <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/05/15/voting-intention-regional-breakdown-apr-24-may-5">it looks like</a> May did the bulk of the work in 2017. Johnson’s – and Cummings’ – brilliance was to leverage it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would only work if they managed to convince the right voters in the right places that Parliament – <em>this</em> Parliament – was the block, and needed replacing. While the rest of us were moaning about prorogation, and mocking Johnson for losing all those votes, he was quietly winning the election – and he hadn’t even called it yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Momentum brigade are just as bad after the election as they were before it. I saw more on my feed from Corbynites trashing the Liberal Democrats than I saw from them criticising the Conservatives. Or even making a positive argument for Labour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relatedly, ‘the media has a right-wing bias’ and ‘FPTP disadvantages us’ are terrible excuses for losing an election. Tough. Of course the media have a right-wing bias. Of course FPTP is a preposterous system that offers the Conservatives an entrenched advantage. We’ve known this for years. The Left needs to learn to work within these constraints rather than decry them. And, this election, Labour <em>singularly</em> failed to do so. This is on you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(By the way, Labour, you had a chance to get rid of FPTP.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ll leave my thoughts on antisemitism in the Labour Party for another day. But they got everything they deserved, and their loss is something to celebrate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Democrats have been bruised, but they’ve been bruised before. And it wasn’t all bad. Increased majorities, a gain in vote share, moving into second place. As my friend E said, if they had held East Dunbartonshire but lost Jamie Stone, they would be saying it was a good night.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it’s likely that ‘presidentialising’ the campaign – “Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats” – killed it more than the revoke Article 50 overreach. As people got to know her more, people liked her less.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, the Conservatives ran a remarkably ugly campaign too, and their victory should be lamented. This was not a victory of ideas. It was the final nail in the coffin that Thatcher and Blair built. Democracy’s epistemic function is over.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being said, I’m a little more optimistic about a Johnson government with a seventy-odd-seat majority rather than a minority, or a 5-seat majority, particularly one enabled by working-class Northern seats. These voters are still, quite rightly, naturally suspicious of the Conservatives. He has very little good will indeed. I think he understands this – his “you’ve lent me your vote” comment is telling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turkeys voting for Christmas? It’s this arrogance and superiority, this smug self-indulgent paternalism (which I’ve indulged in myself) that lost the election for people like me and the ideas I believe in. Of course the average voter doesn’t have the time, skills, knowledge, whatever to make comprehensive, informed decisions. Their vote still counts, and their voice should still be heard. It’s up to politicians to craft a narrative – which is to say, an <em>abstraction</em> of ideas and policy proposals – that resonates with people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it’s easy to forget that most people are instinctively conservative. A lot of people don’t like immigration, or are (reasonably) fearful of its effects. A lot of people don’t like taxes. An increasing number of people have a strongly negative aesthetic response to perceived political correctness, and the social justice movement more broadly. We can debate any of these individual positions until we’re blue in the face, but for a lot of people it’s just a gut thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It now seems clear to me that Remain is no longer an option, democratically or otherwise. We’re not getting a People’s Vote. We are going to leave the European Union, at least formally speaking, in January. In this sense, the debate is over.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another sense, it’s just beginning. Remainers who care about preserving the tangible benefits of EU membership need to plan, regroup, and lean on interest groups, business, the trades unions, local government and the other relevant institutions of civil society to protect or otherwise emulate those benefits in a Brexit context. Democracy doesn’t end between elections (even though it might feel like it does sometimes.) Nor is it only implemented in Westminster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people in my circles – <a href="https://twitter.com/acgrayling">including people who have taught me</a> – are arguing that there’s no mandate for Brexit since the Tories were elected without a majority of the popular vote, or polling suggests slight support for remain, or whatever. This misses the point. We have procedures, whatever issues from those procedures are called democratic, and Brexit, loosely defined, has now issued from those procedures twice. If you don’t like it, change the procedures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might reply with illegal contributions, Russian hacking, lies on busses etc. It’s horrendous, I agree. But I’m starting to think that the fact that enough people <em>believe</em> they voted for Brexit for their own valid reasons, and voted subsequently for the Tories to <em>reaffirm</em> that Brexit position, is enough to make the implementing the outcome both legitimate and indeed required, at least morally speaking (though perhaps not epistemically). You can’t tell people they’re empowered and then not let them wield that power –– certainly not twice. The social contract is a fragile thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m aware of the slippery slope in the point above. I still haven’t figured out what all this means for my theoretical commitments. As with everything in the social sciences – and possibly value theory – it’s a moving target.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was nothing unpatriotic about campaigning for a People’s Vote in the GE. The courts’ suspension of Johnson was not traitorous. People like Dominic Grieve will be looked upon kindly by history. The Remain movement was important, urgent, and its cause noble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we’re having a different conversation now. And I think Remainers need to realise this, lest we beat on, boats against the current. There’s nothing noble in that.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These opinions are, of course, liable to change.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="politics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are a few thoughts, mostly unstructured, and in no particular order, on the general election:]]></summary></entry></feed>
