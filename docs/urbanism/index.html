              <p>Richard Rhodes’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes/dp/1471111237/">The Making of the Atomic Bomb</a> was the highlight this month, a detailed and incredibly scientifically literate story of the agglomeration effects of genius and the construction of the atomic age. A long and detailed book but interesting ideas and stories on every page.</p>

<p>Continually impressed by <a href="https://press.stripe.com">Stripe Press</a> and thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Where-Flying-Car-Storrs-Hall/dp/1953953182">Where Is My Flying Car?</a> by J. Storrs Hall. We need more techno-optimistic books. Hope and ambition are technologies too, and should be developed and promoted.</p>

<p>Also finished <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anarchy-Rise-Fall-India-Company/dp/1408864371">The Anarchy</a> by William Dalrymple. Had the chance to chat to Dalrymple last month and his enthusiasm and perspicuity for this subject is astounding. The EIC was a violent and predictable and transformative institution, but it was at the same time path-dependent and its success subject to utterly unpredictable chance. Every time I read history I’m taken aback by the fragility of the world we’ve inherited.</p>

<p>Some good Visa threads on a cluster of related ideas: <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1436393464468369408">do what you want to do</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1199907654602125312">do it a lot</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1455243916773494784">tell others to do what they want to do</a>.

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/06/02/links-may-2022.html">Links, May 2022</a></h2>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>May was a fine month with lots of social engagements, less writing than I wanted, but quite a lot of reading. I ran the Edinburgh Marathon, my first marathon ever, in four hours and 33 minutes. I wrote a piece on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/05/24/decentralisation-is-a-tradeoff-space.html">Decentralisation as a trade-off space</a>.</p>

<p>To prepare for a debate with my friend David, I read two books on the history of housing development: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-That-Solid-Housing-Disaster/dp/1846147158">All That is Solid</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Municipal-Dreams-Rise-Council-Housing/dp/178478740X">Municipal Dreams</a>. The latter was very good. The former descended into Tory-bashing in the key of Owen Jones, which might be righteous but is also a little tiresome. I also read bits of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Order-without-Design-Markets-Cities/dp/0262038765">Order Without Design</a>, which was truly excellent; it’s good to see urban theory that grounds itself in, and has respect for, economics.</p>

<p>I also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diaries-Two-People-Alastair-Campbell/dp/0099493462">the second volume of Alastair Campbell’s diaries</a>, covering 1997-1999 and the first few salvos of a triumphantly New Labour. The diary format is excellent, since you get an obviously singular perspective as it unfolds. I hadn’t realised quite how little communication mattered in the civil service prior to Blair; lots of Campbell’s agonies involved getting various govt departments to coordinate messaging, routing comms through Number 10. I also had very little idea of how much work went into the Good Friday agreement, or how tenuous it was. Many many chances for it to fall apart. Had Paisley or Trimble or Adams woken up on the wrong side of bed on the wrong morning and the whole thing would have been doomed. From inside government policy seems much more chaotic and stochastic than I had suspected (which might be a reason to be less worried, at least on the margin, about <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch tendencies</a>.)</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shadow-Moon-Challenging-Tranquility-1965-1969/dp/B01DJS9E1A">In the Shadow of the Moon</a> while falling asleep most nights, a very thorough set of biographies and history of the Gemini missions, up to Apollo 11.</p>

<p>As for other links, and continuing on the theme of housing, I also read a few good papers worth reading if the subject appeals to you. Anthony Breach’s <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-06-13-Capital-cities-how-the-planning-system-creates-housing-shortages-and-drives-wealth-inequality.pdf">Capital Cities: How the Planning System Creates Housing Shortages and Drives Wealth Inequality</a> was extremely clear and thorough, UK-specific, and perfect for preparing for an argument with David. <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/">The Housing Theory of Everything</a> helps drive home why this matters so much. YIMBY is a moral argument as much as an economic one.</p>

<p>Campbell’s diaries got me on a bit of a New Labour kick, so I watched <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p09wgbfk/blair-brown-the-new-labour-revolution-series-1-episode-1">last year’s excellent series</a> on Blair and Brown and the 13 years of New Labour government. I’ve also been enjoying <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-politics">The Rest is Politics</a> podcast, hosted by Campbell and Rory Stewart.</p>

<p>Dwarkesh Patel wrote a good post on <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/barbell-strategies">applying the ‘Barbell Strategy’ to everyday life</a>: reframing habit formation and intellectual projects in terms of oscillating between intense focus on one thing and the simplest, lowest-effort thing possible –– which is often nothing at all.</p>

<p>Ken Shiriff is writing some truly excellent, deep work on the technical substrate of the Apollo missions. This is <a href="http://www.righto.com/2022/05/talking-with-moon-inside-apollos.html">a post on the premodulation processor</a>, the signal combinator and splitter in the command module.</p>

<p>We can now make clocks <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/02/jila-atomic-clocks-measure-einsteins-general-relativity-millimeter-scale">so sensitive that they can detect the relativistic difference caused by being one milimetre deeper in the Earth’s gravity well</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/blob/main/projects/OPT/chronicles/OPT175B_Logbook.pdf">a logbook documented while building and deploying</a> one of their NLP models. More companies and people should do this sort of stuff.</p>

<p>Finally, I signed a contract with Apress this week to publish a book on Product Engineering on Ethereum. My aim is to raise the relative status of product engineers – those of us who build everything around smart contracts, UIs, tooling, infrastructure – and explore how the unique processing model of Ethereum puts important constraints on the way we build software. I’ll be posting some pieces here as I work through the first draft, so keep an eye out if you’re interested.</p>
