            <div class="post-content">
              <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Ethereum-Products-Protocols-Platforms/dp/1484290445">My book is out!</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742">The Mom Test</a> is one of those books that I would never have read if I didn’t need to for work, and was instantly thrilled that I had. Having productive conversations is one of those meta-skills that gets way too little attention but underpins basically every other piece of pedagogy. This book helps you have those conversations.</p>

<p>I’ve been working through many, but not all, of the essays in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adventures-Computational-Explorer-Stephen-Wolfram/dp/1579550266">Adventures of a Computational Explorer</a> by Stephen Wolfram. I suspect we’ll know within 15-20 years whether Wolfram’s big, and somewhat esoteric, scientific bet – that the universe is built bottom-up from the emergent properties of simple computational rules – is true. But many of the essays aren’t about that at all. They present an attractive model for the productive life. (Wolfram sits in roughly the same region of my embedding space as Tyler Cowen for this reason.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1785785508">Dark Matter and Dark Energy: The Hidden 95% of the Universe</a> was interesting, clear, well-written, but like so many of these sorts of books it became rushed at just the same moment that its content got interesting.</p>

<p>I’m still digesting C. P. Snow’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Two-Cultures-Canto-Classics/dp/1107606144">The Two Cultures</a>. I suspect it might be the most important book I will read this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation">Jessica’s work on LLM feature visualisation</a> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SolidGoldMagikarp</code> token was released to, well, quite some acclaim. Cool to have the Rumbelow name known for something other than failed television retailing, Ripperology, ecoactivism, or pompous tech blogging.</p>

<p>Good Matt Clancy post <a href="https://mattsclancy.substack.com/p/innovators-who-immigrate">on productivity and immigration</a>.</p>

<p>Somebody hired a team of people to sit behind him and keep him on task. <a href="https://simonberens.me/blog/i-hired-5-people">Panoptiproductivity!</a></p>

<p>We’re planning on having children soon, and will likely home-school. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CYN7swrefEss4e3Qe/childhoods-of-exceptional-people">This post on the childhoods of exceptional people</a> did nothing to dissuade me.</p>

<p>I liked this post about <a href="https://apoorvagovind.substack.com/p/how-to-waste-your-career-one-comfortable">ways to waste your early career.</a>. My big takeaway: you can change things. Matches my more general prior that one should, on the margin, do the thing that cultivates excellence.</p>

              <p>A quiet month, beginning new projects, getting back into a routine, ruminating. I have managed to read <em>zero books</em> this month, which isn’t great. I’ll do better in February.</p>

<p>A couple of good best-of-2022 threads: one on <a href="https://twitter.com/arnauddyevre/status/1609160058448887808?s=46&amp;t=f7jMAhdBTraiXOsYebkRwQ">economics of growth/firms papers</a>, Davis Kedrosky’s <a href="https://twitter.com/dkedrosky/status/1609240961745588228">favourite books</a>, and Erik Thorenberg’s <a href="https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1609703100394393600?s=46&amp;t=698SPPgzbhBtEICkAcmN-w">favourite podcast episodes</a>.</p>

<p>Zvi on Patrick Mackenzie on VaccinateCA. And the original.</p>

<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506221098921">This was interesting</a>: people who are born poor and become rich tend to be less sympathetic to the poor than those who are born rich.

<p>Aella wrote <a href="https://aella.substack.com/p/you-dont-need-a-perfectly-random">something smart on statistics and Twitter polling</a>.</p>

<p>Francis Galton tried to <a href="https://galton.org/essays/1890-1899/galton-1894-smell.pdf">perform arithemetic by smell</a>. Reminds me somewhat of Chapter 2 of Strawson’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Individuals-descriptive-metaphysics-P-F-Strawson/dp/0415051851">Individuals</a>, where Strawson manages to derive spaciotemporal concepts from auditory input alone. (In fact, it’s a useful mental trick for idea generation: does some context C’ have the resources to support some activity X that is normally performed in context C?)</p>

<p>More Zvi, this time on <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/escape-velocity-from-bullshit-jobs">bullshit jobs and AI</a>.</p>

<p>Fantastic thread <a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang/status/1613977673067540480">on the Korean Jeonse system</a>. (File this under the category of ‘social/legal systems very different from our own’)</p>

<p>I’m really enjoying using the <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc Browser</a>, so much so that it’s now my default browser. It’s one of those rare pieces of software that rethinks, successfully, something basic to the computing experience. There just aren’t many people innovating at the Browser level, and Arc are doing an amazing job.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Holes-Key-Understanding-Universe/dp/0008350752">Black Holes</a> was an excellent audiobook. So was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/House-Cards-Trilogy-Book/dp/B07CZDVGX6">House of Cards</a>.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Writing lots this month, finishing up the manuscript for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Ethereum-Products-Protocols-Platforms/dp/1484290445">Building With Ethereum: Products, Protocols, and Platforms</a>. Decided to restructure it all halfway through the first draft, which has meant a lot of rewriting. I’m learning a lot about how to sustain an argument over ~300 pages, and what makes for clear, technical exposition.</p>

<p>Managed to dash out something small on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/10/09/alphatensor-scaling.html">AlphaTensor and research taste</a>. Since I noticed this taste dynamic, it keeps popping up everywhere. It’s certainly not a new insight, but it’s something I see addressed an unfortunately small amount in the philosophy of science literature. The scientist is taken as some a priori given to most philosophical models of science, which, if my observation is correct, is skipping over perhaps the most important part of the analysis. Feyerabend gestures towards it in Against Method, but, again, doesn’t quite get there.</p>

<p>I’ve also been reading a lot. Winston Churchill’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Early-Life-Winston-Churchill/dp/0907871623">My Early Life</a> was a delightful, charming piece of Kipling-hued imperialism. His world-view is so remote from ours, so free of moral ambiguity. It’s a decidedly Victorian book, of heroes and adventures, a sort of anti-Le Carré. He is a wonderful writer and a gifted storyteller. Well worth a read.</p>

<p>Charles Petzold’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a> was also extremely good. He builds up an intuitive model for digital computing, from the very basics of Morse code via flashlights to complex microprocessors. This was a fill-in-the-gaps book for me, something I could read quickly – I finished it in two days – but has meaningfully added to my basic understanding. I didn’t, for instance, have a clear idea of a CPU’s clock cycle, which this book has changed superlatively. It was funny, too.</p>

<p>Just finished Simon Morden’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Planet-Natural-History-Mars/dp/1783966610/">The Red Planet: A Natural History of Mars</a>, which I’m reading in a cluster with some other Mars books. More top spacey content! Good passages on competing theories of crust formation and covers the basics of the protoplanetary disc super well. Makes me want to write something similar on Saturn (an infinitely more mysterious and beautiful planet.)</p>

<p>And, of course, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cosmos-Cosmic-Evolution-Science-Civilisation/dp/0349107033">Cosmos</a> by Carl Sagan. It has taken me 27 years to read a book that I should have read in my early teens. I felt a flickering rememberance of days past, that wide-eyed, ambitious, weird young boy, trying to understand who he was and why he was so unhappy. If I had read this book then, I suspect I’d be a scientist now – and would have become much more content with my weirdness.</p>

<p>My first Interintellect Salon, <a href="https://interintellect.com/salon/freedom-and-love-in-the-music-of-joni-mitchell/">Freedom and Love in the Music of Joni Mitchell</a> is later this month. Should be wonderfully self-indulgent and fun.</p>

<p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-concrete-vision-of-the-liberal">A concrete vision of the liberal democratic future</a> from Noah Smith, and a more pointed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scarcity-crisis-college-housing-health-care/621221/">piece on the abundance agenda</a>. This quote from Noah stuck with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final thing that the liberal democratic vision needs is a way to accommodate conservatives. The divisions within the democratic world are the primary reason why the autocratic powers are able to make their case at all. But a great many people within any society, including liberal democratic ones, are socially conservative to a greater or lesser degree. If the vision of the future that liberal democracies present is one where conservative values have been wiped from the Earth, then conservatives will feel they have no choice but to embrace reactionary illiberalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from Noah, <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-per-capita-emissions-is-a-bad">why per-capita emissions is a bad framing for the carbon debate</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of anti-EA discourse began in our little corner of the Internet this month. Liam Kofi Bright made a fair point that the evaluative standards of the movement’s critics seem <a href="https://twitter.com/lastpositivist/status/1578695082748055553">radically out-of-whack</a>. David Shor <a href="https://twitter.com/davidshor/status/1578779382545530886">gave a good reply</a> about the psychology of the median EA member (via Nadia). And Nathan <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/effective-altruism#An_attempt_at_a_minimal_set_of_effective_altruism_axioms">put together an attempt at a minimal set of EA axioms</a> that is worth reading.</p>

<p>Really enjoying the <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com">Pedestrian Observations</a> blog, another good example (along with Construction Physics) of the single-issue blog that <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/">Patrick and Tyler discussed</a> back in 2017:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COLLISON: What kinds of blogs should there be more of in the world?</p>

  <p>COWEN: Single-issue blogs on issues of importance. If you take something like penal reform, an underrated cause. Prisons, I think, are barbaric, but it’s not an easy problem to solve. There’s not a quick fix. Some people do need to be constrained in some way. The idea that there should be more blogs that track that and persistently deliver the message, “Something is wrong here.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A great paper on <a href="https://stephenjarvis.github.io/files/jarvis_jmp_nimbyism_renewable_energy.pdf">The Economic Costs of NIMBYism</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using hedonic methods I find that wind projects can impose significant external local costs, while solar projects do not. I then show that planning officials are particularly sensitive to local costs in their area. The resulting misallocation of investment may have increased wind power deployment costs by 10-29%.</p>

              <p>Wrapped up my work with Fei Labs this week, and am now unemployed again, poking around the edges of opportunities and building a stronger sense of what I want to work on next. My book on product engineering with Ethereum is coming along well; I should have the first draft done in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I’ve been rewatching <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80025678">The Crown</a>, partly in preparation for the new season, partly to revisit the life of Elizabeth II, and most of all because I have had several casual conversations with friends on various topics in 20th-century British political history, and I wanted a lightweight set of touch points, nudges toward various prime ministers and political events that I might read into more deeply. As a result, almost all of my reading time has been taken up with television. It’s amazing how easily that can happen!</p>

<p>I did, however, manage to reread <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135">Stubborn Attachments</a> by Tyler Cowen. It was much less surprising and enjoyable on rereading, but I suppose that’s a sign of a book whose ideas seem to be more mainstream, whose arguments are more familiar and plausible, whose memes have sunk in to my brain. If I have any criticisms now, it’s that it isn’t ambitious or controversial enough; he caveats the demand for growth by demanding sustainable growth; he builds a broader normative pluralism into a notion of ‘Wealth+’; both of which feel more like a concession to the zeitgeist rather than a serious commitment.</p>

<p>Reminder that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9lqW3pQDcUuugXLIpzcUdA">YouTube has some 400 episodes of Buckley’s Firing Line interviews</a>, and they’re still extremely good. (Has anybody put the audio into a podcast stream yet?)</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>May was a fine month with lots of social engagements, less writing than I wanted, but quite a lot of reading. I ran the Edinburgh Marathon, my first marathon ever, in four hours and 33 minutes. I wrote a piece on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/05/24/decentralisation-is-a-tradeoff-space.html">Decentralisation as a trade-off space</a>.</p>

<p>To prepare for a debate with my friend David, I read two books on the history of housing development: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-That-Solid-Housing-Disaster/dp/1846147158">All That is Solid</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Municipal-Dreams-Rise-Council-Housing/dp/178478740X">Municipal Dreams</a>. The latter was very good. The former descended into Tory-bashing in the key of Owen Jones, which might be righteous but is also a little tiresome. I also read bits of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Order-without-Design-Markets-Cities/dp/0262038765">Order Without Design</a>, which was truly excellent; it’s good to see urban theory that grounds itself in, and has respect for, economics.</p>

<p>I also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diaries-Two-People-Alastair-Campbell/dp/0099493462">the second volume of Alastair Campbell’s diaries</a>, covering 1997-1999 and the first few salvos of a triumphantly New Labour. The diary format is excellent, since you get an obviously singular perspective as it unfolds. I hadn’t realised quite how little communication mattered in the civil service prior to Blair; lots of Campbell’s agonies involved getting various govt departments to coordinate messaging, routing comms through Number 10. I also had very little idea of how much work went into the Good Friday agreement, or how tenuous it was. Many many chances for it to fall apart. Had Paisley or Trimble or Adams woken up on the wrong side of bed on the wrong morning and the whole thing would have been doomed. From inside government policy seems much more chaotic and stochastic than I had suspected (which might be a reason to be less worried, at least on the margin, about <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch tendencies</a>.)</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shadow-Moon-Challenging-Tranquility-1965-1969/dp/B01DJS9E1A">In the Shadow of the Moon</a> while falling asleep most nights, a very thorough set of biographies and history of the Gemini missions, up to Apollo 11.</p>

<p>As for other links, and continuing on the theme of housing, I also read a few good papers worth reading if the subject appeals to you. Anthony Breach’s <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-06-13-Capital-cities-how-the-planning-system-creates-housing-shortages-and-drives-wealth-inequality.pdf">Capital Cities: How the Planning System Creates Housing Shortages and Drives Wealth Inequality</a> was extremely clear and thorough, UK-specific, and perfect for preparing for an argument with David. <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/">The Housing Theory of Everything</a> helps drive home why this matters so much. YIMBY is a moral argument as much as an economic one.</p>

<p>Campbell’s diaries got me on a bit of a New Labour kick, so I watched <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p09wgbfk/blair-brown-the-new-labour-revolution-series-1-episode-1">last year’s excellent series</a> on Blair and Brown and the 13 years of New Labour government. I’ve also been enjoying <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-politics">The Rest is Politics</a> podcast, hosted by Campbell and Rory Stewart.</p>

<p>Dwarkesh Patel wrote a good post on <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/barbell-strategies">applying the ‘Barbell Strategy’ to everyday life</a>: reframing habit formation and intellectual projects in terms of oscillating between intense focus on one thing and the simplest, lowest-effort thing possible –– which is often nothing at all.</p>

<p>Ken Shiriff is writing some truly excellent, deep work on the technical substrate of the Apollo missions. This is <a href="http://www.righto.com/2022/05/talking-with-moon-inside-apollos.html">a post on the premodulation processor</a>, the signal combinator and splitter in the command module.</p>

<p>We can now make clocks <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/02/jila-atomic-clocks-measure-einsteins-general-relativity-millimeter-scale">so sensitive that they can detect the relativistic difference caused by being one milimetre deeper in the Earth’s gravity well</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/blob/main/projects/OPT/chronicles/OPT175B_Logbook.pdf">a logbook documented while building and deploying</a> one of their NLP models. More companies and people should do this sort of stuff.</p>

<p>Finally, I signed a contract with Apress this week to publish a book on Product Engineering on Ethereum. My aim is to raise the relative status of product engineers – those of us who build everything around smart contracts, UIs, tooling, infrastructure – and explore how the unique processing model of Ethereum puts important constraints on the way we build software. I’ll be posting some pieces here as I work through the first draft, so keep an eye out if you’re interested.</p>
