            <p>December passed by in a blur, with our wedding, my birthday, a lot of travel, and more champagne than I care to mention. I had plenty of time to read and relax, and have found myself in January with a newfound sense of focus and purpose. I am a part of something bigger now. The boundaries of my responsibilities extend beyond myself. I now owe myself, my ambitions, my successes, fully to another person. A conspiracy of two.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Project-Hail-Mary-Andy-Weir/dp/0593135202">Project Hail Mary</a> was fun, although I think it tried to be too smart – the science was a little too complicated in a way that felt unbelievable – which made it a poorer book than the Martian. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X">The Man Who Solved The Market</a> was just interesting enough to get me through a four-hour flight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/publication/a-very-short-guide-to-planning-reform/">A very short guide to planning reform</a>, a useful resource to lean on when YIMBY-proselytising. Addresses a lot of the common misconceptions. And <a href="https://stephenhoskins.notion.site/Pennington-K-2021-Does-Building-New-Housing-Cause-Displacement-The-Supply-and-Demand-Effects--505dfd143406488d956eaa59e2435dbb">gentrification without displacement</a>.</p>

<p>Jatan curates some <a href="https://blog.jatan.space/p/lunasights">photos of the Moon</a>. The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apollo-Remastered-Andy-Saunders/dp/024150869X">Apollo Remastered book is astounding</a>. And Andrew McCarthy gives us the <a href="https://twitter.com/AJamesMcCarthy/status/1600749501664612353">following gift</a>:</p>

<p>ChatGPT can <a href="https://maximumeffort.substack.com/p/i-taught-chatgpt-to-invent-a-language">invent a fairly consistent, heavily inflected language</a>. A fun example use, but I’ll be more impressed when it develops some irregular verbs from some sort of environmental or phonetic pressure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.getguesstimate.com">Guesstimate</a> is a really good little tool for generating Fermi estimates.</p>

<p>Science has been doing an experiment on itself for the past 60 years. That experiment is called ‘peer review’, and <a href="https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-peer-review">it failed</a>.</p>

<p>Rohit performs <a href="https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/agi-strange-equation">a Fermi estimate for scary AI</a>.</p>

<p>Gavin Leech’s <a href="https://twitter.com/g_leech_/status/1607313892644122626">papers of the year list</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LlamaInaTux/status/1607392231119360007">2022’s Twitter trends</a>. A brilliant reminder of how ephemeral most of the discourse is.</p>

<p>Lowell <a href="https://twitter.com/lucafrighetti/status/1607758734306193409">projects his own eyeball onto Mars and Venus</a>.</p>
