              <p>Richard Rhodes’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes/dp/1471111237/">The Making of the Atomic Bomb</a> was the highlight this month, a detailed and incredibly scientifically literate story of the agglomeration effects of genius and the construction of the atomic age. A long and detailed book but interesting ideas and stories on every page.</p>

<p>Continually impressed by <a href="https://press.stripe.com">Stripe Press</a> and thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Where-Flying-Car-Storrs-Hall/dp/1953953182">Where Is My Flying Car?</a> by J. Storrs Hall. We need more techno-optimistic books. Hope and ambition are technologies too, and should be developed and promoted.</p>

<p>Also finished <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anarchy-Rise-Fall-India-Company/dp/1408864371">The Anarchy</a> by William Dalrymple. Had the chance to chat to Dalrymple last month and his enthusiasm and perspicuity for this subject is astounding. The EIC was a violent and predictable and transformative institution, but it was at the same time path-dependent and its success subject to utterly unpredictable chance. Every time I read history I’m taken aback by the fragility of the world we’ve inherited.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/08/27/state-adjacent-institutions.html">State-Adjacent Institutions</a></h2>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>From Dominic Cummings’s recent <a href="https://dominiccummings.substack.com/p/snippets-5-no10-farce-ukr-tory-strategy">‘Snippets 5’</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NSN searched for people who wanted to start new schools that we intended to allow under new legislation then worked with them on their application.</p>

  <p>It developed specific ideas for how the system should work. Unlike normal think tanks, it worked at the extreme detail end of the spectrum, like drafting actual forms that the DfE could use.</p>

  <p>We thought that if we helped people develop specific projects and could actually bend the bureaucracy, we could get ‘Free Schools’ going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is interesting, because it suggests a model for <em>state-adjacent</em> institutions that support the functions of the state without being tied to the bureaucracy or subject to the incentives. Something somewhere in the midpoint between a management consultancy, a think tank, and a training institute.</p>

<p>It seems like this sort of model is beneficial in specific circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Where there is considerable state funding for a certain industry / project / goal</strong>, where ‘considerable’ is relative to the industry / project / goal. (You need more money to make a new nuclear power plant design than you do a school.)</li>
  <li><strong>Where access to that funding is reasonably competitive.</strong> This means it needs to be accessible to SMEs or small teams, rather than just Serco, G4S, the major universities, and the other big boys.</li>
  <li><strong>Where the government department distributing the funding is receptive to introductions, advice, support</strong>. A lot of the benefits seem to come from new ideas being introduced revisited through a feedback loop, so the department must be flexible enough to integrate the state-adjacent institution into its decision making – or, at least, leave its door open to such input. Generally, I suspect, departments are only really flexible in this sort of way during their first few years and for a year or two after a major shake-up (eg DoE under Gove).</li>
</ul>

<p>A few ideas where this could be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ‘ARIA Attractor’: finding individuals / teams with audacious projects, helping them refine their proposals, and using the knowledge gained from the search to help shape the department’s broader research focus.</li>
  <li>An analogous attractor for the UKRI / NIH / other ‘normal science’ funding bodies, with an emphasis on speeding up the funding application process.</li>
  <li>Standards setting and guidance for navigating the planning system, but beyond a simple planning consultancy. A team of people who work hard to befriend and effectively lobby local planning teams, giving developers large and small the opportunity to boot up to the activation energy required to get anything built. It would be useful to focus on local authorities with a recent change in governance, or with an especially acute housing problem, where the demand to do something is greater.</li>
  <li>A company to abstract away the medical licensing and compliance process and help guide new teams / University spin-offs to apply for medical licenses. Medical software, in particular, is notoriously hard to get adequate licensing for. A team dedicated to building solutions and increasing governmental awareness of these issues, working with funding bodies and NHS clinical commissioning groups, could meaningfully move the needle on what innovation we permit in the medical space (<a href="https://www.scarletcomply.com">Scarlet</a> are doing interesting things adjacent to this idea.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating and supporting these sorts of state-adjacent institutions could be an important <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pfbLKnJmDKYSPPCEW/four-focus-areas-of-effective-altruism">focus area</a> for a movement like Effective Altruism.</p>

<p>But it could also be a powerful new framing for start-ups themselves: many of these ideas could grow into profitable businesses as well as institutions with positive-sum state/business interactions.</p>

<p>Asking the question “how can the private or non-profit sector smooth over the relationship between the state and others?” is a subtly different question – and one with (in many cases perhaps) more leverage than the simpler question “how can the state do things more effectively?”</p>

<p>Why? Because it refocuses the conversation on what can be done <em>practically</em>, today, without needing large-scale systemic reform, without needing to push through the <a href="https://dominiccummings.com/tag/procurement/">ossified systems of government purchasing</a> and permits that sit in deeply suboptimal equilibria.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>ETHCC Paris, The Idler Festival, dinners at the Liberal Club, work on the book, actual work, and learning to fly; it’s been a busy month in which I deadlifted 100kg for the first time, only read a couple of books, submitted the first few chapters of <strong>Products, Protocols, and Platforms</strong>, and have found myself exhausted. I am more energised when I am productive, and more productive when I am energised, so ascertaining how to bootstrap myself into either productivity or energy is I think a high-leverage activity with which I’ll be experimenting for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing I read this month was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eichmann-Jerusalem-Report-Banality-Evil/dp/024155229X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Eichmann in Jerusalem</a>. I didn’t quite realise how much of a journalist Arendt was, and look forward to reading more of her political theory in the future. It’s rare, nowadays, to go from in-the-trenches journalism to academic theorising. (Counterexamples: Gramsci, sort of? Maybe Robert Caro? Anne Applebaum, perhaps?)</p>

<p>Also supplemented Arendt with Richard Evans’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Third-Reich-Power-1933-Hearts/dp/0141009764">Third Reich in Power</a>, the second volume in the series. I read the first volume maybe a decade ago and enjoyed it. The second was more of a slog.</p>

<p>Just finished <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hard-Drive-Making-Microsoft-Empire/dp/0887306292/ref=sr_1_1?crid=D7B2ZBP7Q351&amp;keywords=hard+drive+bill+gates&amp;qid=1659523562&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=hard+drive+bi%2Cstripbooks%2C798&amp;sr=1-1">Hard Drive</a>, a book about Bill Gates and the early days of Microsoft. Gates was a <em>lot</em> more competitive and ruthless than I thought – and I thought he was pretty competitive and ruthless!</p>

<p>Also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154">All Out War</a> by Tim Shipman. Fantastic political journalism, no agenda, just the steady beat and the sporadic bursts of a battle unfolding.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ryancbriggs/status/1544321988101128195?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Political science is horribly underpowered.</a> I am in a cynical mood right now, so don’t expect these findings to change much.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/johncoogan/status/1546921877586604032">A logarithmic map of the entire universe</a>.</p>

<p>A good post from Tanner <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/the-fall-of-history-as-a-major-and-as-a-part-of-the-humanities/">on the decline of history majors</a> and the relationship between the sciences and the humanities. Also a very well-written letter <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/criq.12675">on decolonising the curriculum</a> and the contradictions inherent in it.</p>

<p>There’s something very distinctive about the ‘long-form interviews with macho men for a predominantly working-to-lower-middle-class white male audience that leans right’ format, and I can’t quite put my finger on what it is. It’s far from anti-intellectualism: the hosts and their guests are smart and eager to grapple with complicated ideas. It’s not quite one-sidedness, because they can surprised you. It’s almost an aesthetic property, a flavour of self-assuredness, the eschewing of the effete. Whatever it is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwK_XLFOm_I">this interview with Erik Prince</a> was swimming in it.</p>

<p>Wonderful lecture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n068fel-W9I">on the F-22 Raptor and the engineering decisions behind it</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://justinehsmith.substack.com/p/two-years-on-substack">Justin E. H. Smith reviews his two years on Substack.</a></p>

<p>Brie Wolfson wrote <a href="https://every.to/p/what-i-miss-about-working-at-stripe">on the work culture early-days Stripe</a>. A reminder that hard work is a feature, not a bug – and the symptom of a thriving culture, not the cause of it.</p>

<p>Ordinary citizens have <a href="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2016/01/american-and-chinese-oligarchies.html">essentially no influence over government in the United States</a>. What the elites want, they generally get. It’s amazing that US society is generally so stable.</p>

              <p>Found myself in somewhat of a funk this month, low on energy and motivation. My usual menu of neuroses bubbling up and my usual response; fits-and-starts of bouyancy followed by lethargy. Unhappy with my work. I think I need a holiday. And twenty more IQ points.</p>

<p>Anyway, not much writing, just <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/06/27/wallets-as-identity.html">Wallets As Identity</a>, a rough first draft of a chapter from the Ethereum book.</p>

<p>I began five books but only finished one: Feyerabend’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Against-Method-Paul-K-Feyerabend/dp/1844674428">Against Method</a>. I intend to write in more detail about it, because it was both very good and also rather illegible. After some effort, I think I have a clear idea of what he is trying to do, but I can’t see how his arguments don’t collapse into a much broader scepticism. <a href="https://twitter.com/JamieRumbelow/status/1535955057966989313">Here’s a Twitter thread</a> with some quotes I enjoyed.</p>

<p>The unabridged edition of <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/A-History-of-Britain-Volume-1-Audiobook/B0094OI6U4">Simon Schama’s History of Great Britain series</a> is wonderful – Schama writes so well – and it’s currently included with any Audible subscription, although that will change this month.</p>

<p><a href="https://sriramk.com/memos.html">A collection of memos</a> ‘written for an internal audience’, mostly business and technology but some politics too. Diaries and letters and other documentary on how the sausage gets made gives you a good sense for 1. the trade-offs involved in absolutely everything, something that is easy to consider intellectually and much harder to feel intuitively, 2. how chaotic and unregimentable progress is a priori, and 3. the sheer variability of approaches and styles of success and failure.</p>

<p>Michael Nielsen writes on <a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/">effective altruism</a> and his take on its problems providing a moral core for an individual’s life.</p>

<p>A friend pointed me to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1FPKMooGfbOGzESM1G2ffC?si=e2cb4c6bb8d6440b&amp;nd=1">this Dylan B-side</a>, from the Blood on the Tracks sessions. Lovely and sad and detached. Dylan’s narrator is always at arm’s length from his subject, even when he’s singing about himself.</p>

<p>Two useful reviews of The Future of Fusion Energy, <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2022/01/03/future-of-fusion-energy.html">one</a> from Martin Kleppman, <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-future-of-fusion">the other</a> from the Astral Codex Ten book review contest: the former reviews the book, the latter reviews its content.</p>

<p>Toby Ord on <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2104/2104.01191.pdf">the knowability of the Edges of the Universe</a>; and a fun lecture from Stuart Armstrong on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQTfuI-9jIo">how we might get there</a>.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>May was a fine month with lots of social engagements, less writing than I wanted, but quite a lot of reading. I ran the Edinburgh Marathon, my first marathon ever, in four hours and 33 minutes. I wrote a piece on <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/05/24/decentralisation-is-a-tradeoff-space.html">Decentralisation as a trade-off space</a>.</p>

<p>To prepare for a debate with my friend David, I read two books on the history of housing development: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-That-Solid-Housing-Disaster/dp/1846147158">All That is Solid</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Municipal-Dreams-Rise-Council-Housing/dp/178478740X">Municipal Dreams</a>. The latter was very good. The former descended into Tory-bashing in the key of Owen Jones, which might be righteous but is also a little tiresome. I also read bits of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Order-without-Design-Markets-Cities/dp/0262038765">Order Without Design</a>, which was truly excellent; it’s good to see urban theory that grounds itself in, and has respect for, economics.</p>

<p>I also read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diaries-Two-People-Alastair-Campbell/dp/0099493462">the second volume of Alastair Campbell’s diaries</a>, covering 1997-1999 and the first few salvos of a triumphantly New Labour. The diary format is excellent, since you get an obviously singular perspective as it unfolds. I hadn’t realised quite how little communication mattered in the civil service prior to Blair; lots of Campbell’s agonies involved getting various govt departments to coordinate messaging, routing comms through Number 10. I also had very little idea of how much work went into the Good Friday agreement, or how tenuous it was. Many many chances for it to fall apart. Had Paisley or Trimble or Adams woken up on the wrong side of bed on the wrong morning and the whole thing would have been doomed. From inside government policy seems much more chaotic and stochastic than I had suspected (which might be a reason to be less worried, at least on the margin, about <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch tendencies</a>.)</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shadow-Moon-Challenging-Tranquility-1965-1969/dp/B01DJS9E1A">In the Shadow of the Moon</a> while falling asleep most nights, a very thorough set of biographies and history of the Gemini missions, up to Apollo 11.</p>

<p>As for other links, and continuing on the theme of housing, I also read a few good papers worth reading if the subject appeals to you. Anthony Breach’s <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-06-13-Capital-cities-how-the-planning-system-creates-housing-shortages-and-drives-wealth-inequality.pdf">Capital Cities: How the Planning System Creates Housing Shortages and Drives Wealth Inequality</a> was extremely clear and thorough, UK-specific, and perfect for preparing for an argument with David. <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/">The Housing Theory of Everything</a> helps drive home why this matters so much. YIMBY is a moral argument as much as an economic one.</p>

<p>Campbell’s diaries got me on a bit of a New Labour kick, so I watched <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p09wgbfk/blair-brown-the-new-labour-revolution-series-1-episode-1">last year’s excellent series</a> on Blair and Brown and the 13 years of New Labour government. I’ve also been enjoying <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/the-rest-is-politics">The Rest is Politics</a> podcast, hosted by Campbell and Rory Stewart.</p>

<p>Dwarkesh Patel wrote a good post on <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/barbell-strategies">applying the ‘Barbell Strategy’ to everyday life</a>: reframing habit formation and intellectual projects in terms of oscillating between intense focus on one thing and the simplest, lowest-effort thing possible –– which is often nothing at all.</p>

<p>Ken Shiriff is writing some truly excellent, deep work on the technical substrate of the Apollo missions. This is <a href="http://www.righto.com/2022/05/talking-with-moon-inside-apollos.html">a post on the premodulation processor</a>, the signal combinator and splitter in the command module.</p>

<p>We can now make clocks <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/02/jila-atomic-clocks-measure-einsteins-general-relativity-millimeter-scale">so sensitive that they can detect the relativistic difference caused by being one milimetre deeper in the Earth’s gravity well</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/blob/main/projects/OPT/chronicles/OPT175B_Logbook.pdf">a logbook documented while building and deploying</a> one of their NLP models. More companies and people should do this sort of stuff.</p>

<p>Finally, I signed a contract with Apress this week to publish a book on Product Engineering on Ethereum. My aim is to raise the relative status of product engineers – those of us who build everything around smart contracts, UIs, tooling, infrastructure – and explore how the unique processing model of Ethereum puts important constraints on the way we build software. I’ll be posting some pieces here as I work through the first draft, so keep an eye out if you’re interested.</p>

              <p>A lot of spacey content this month, and a lot of crypto, as I left my old job at Pactio and moved into crypto full-time:</p>

<p>Finally got round to reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Value-must-read-politics-economics-Governor/dp/0008421099">Values by Mark Carney.</a> Seesaws from economic theory to memoir in a not-uninteresting way. Carney writes well, but sets things up in such a manner as to make his premises seem more interesting than this conclusions. A very safe book. I imagine he’s going to run for public office in Canada some time soon.</p>

<p>Also enjoyed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Law-Venture-Capital-Making/dp/052555999X">The Power Law by Sebastian Mallaby</a>. Clean writing, thoroughly researched.</p>

<p>Curricula for self-teaching <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/math">maths</a> and <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics">physics</a> from Susan Rigetti.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/03/09/enthusiastic-amateurs.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2022/03/10/enthusiastic-amateurs-some-tips.html">posts</a> on being an enthusiastic amateur.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/space/james-webb-telescope-first-images/">first test image from the James Webb Telescope</a>, of the star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope#Commissioning_and_testing">HD 84406</a> is pretty spectacular (and even more so the more you learn about it.) You can clearly see the spiralling of the galaxies in the background, each one comprising on average 100 billion stars, and many of them billions of lightyears away. The scale of space is very hard to comprehend.</p>

<p>Nadia Eghbal <a href="https://nayafia.substack.com/p/out-of-the-valley">is writing again</a>, which is always a joyous event, this first new essay a gesture toward a broader project on philanthropy and the tech industry. Her prose is both incisive and imagistic, twisting and deforming ideas in the best way possible, finding their veins, snapping them like kindling.</p>

<p>An essay on <a href="https://handsandcities.com/2022/01/30/on-infinite-ethics/">infinite ethics</a>, an approach to ethics that takes the existence of infinites seriously, and how infinity fits into the logical structure of existing mainstream ethical theories.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/9lines.html">All of physics in nine lines</a>. I’m surprised the basic theoretical scheme of physics is so parsimonious. (Although it might not <strong>actually</strong> be that parsimonious and this is expository slight-of-hand. What, for instance, explains why there are 27 constants?)</p>

<p>A fun collection of <a href="https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20">weird ERC-20 contracts</a>, mostly exploits or incompatibilities with conventions.</p>

<p>I enjoyed watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58eKnYR_EyM">this episode of Solidity Fridays</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/transmissions11">transmissions11</a>. He articulates trade-offs very well. I took voluminous notes that I’ll type up soon.</p>

<p>On top of my normal reading, I listened to three audiobooks this month. The first, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Spacefarers-Humans-Will-Settle-Beyond/dp/067498448X">Spacefarers by Christopher Wanjek</a>, is freely available to Audible subscribers, and a smart and deeply technical look about the next thousand years of spaceflight.</p>

<p>The second, <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Planets-Audiobook/0008294313">The Planets by Andrew Cohen and Brian Cox</a>, is a book about the history and physics of the Solar System, a companion to the 2019 BBC television series (which is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p06qj2l5/the-planets-series-1-1-a-moment-in-the-sun-the-terrestrial-planets">itself really excellent</a>.) Samuel West’s narration is extremely good, and Cohen is a talented science writer.</p>

<p>The third, also <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Search-for-Exoplanets-What-Astronomers-Know-Audiobook/B0159LVSNC">available for free on Audible</a>, was a collection of Scientific American articles about Exoplanets. The article format is helpful, and the narrator’s voice is just monotonal enough to fall asleep to.</p>

<p>Emily St. John Mandel wrote <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/59815561-station-eleven/30386465-emily-mandel">a series of notes on GoodReads</a>, discussing various passages from her excellent novel Station Eleven.</p>

A lot of the time, its success hinges simply on whether people can understand it.</p>

<p>A very, very good blog post on <a href="https://policyskeptic.blogspot.com/2022/03/the-biggest-problem-holding-back-nhs.html">NHS performance</a>. We need more LessWrong-style analyses of British government policy.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2021/05/16/books-i-wish-existed.html">Books I Wish Existed</a></h2>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>For a while I’ve been collecting a list of interesting book-length projects. Since I’m never going to write the bloody things, I figured it’d be better to throw them into the light of day and see what daylight makes of them.
Here is a preliminary, first stab at a list of books I wish existed: books that haven’t been written yet, but could be.</p>

<p><strong>A collection of short books on the history and interpretation of U.S. constitutional amendments</strong></p>

<p>One under-explored feature of the US constitution is its deep cultural, as well as judicial, role in modern American politics. Each amendment has its own motivations, historical context, and judicial precedent; but each amendment also serves as the starting point for contemporary arguments for or against certain policies: even, today, <a href="https://theconversation.com/im-a-first-amendment-scholar-and-i-think-big-tech-should-be-left-alone-153287">the policies of private companies</a>.</p>

<p>I’d like to see a series of short, concise, focussed books – think roughly the length and depth of the <a href="https://www.veryshortintroductions.com/">OUP Very Short Introductions</a> series – with each volume focussed around an amendment to the U.S. constitution. Each book could discuss the amendment’s historical context, important cases in its subsequent judicial precedent, and the moral and legal and institutional justifications for the amendment and how they have changed.</p>

<p>Most amendments would have their own volume, while some of the more arcane amendments might be bundled together, where appropriate. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">18th &amp; 21st</a> are a natural pairing; the 13th, 14th and 15th sit snugly together in terms of their shared historical context, but are perhaps each significant enough, with their own rich set of continuing precedent and relevance, for their own volumes; perhaps the 3rd, 4th and 5th. It might also be interesting to conclude the series with a volume on the amendments that didn’t get passed: amongst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proposed_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution">many others</a>, the ERA, balanced budget amendments, the We the People amendment.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing Like A Startup</strong></p>

<p>Scott’s <em>Seeing Like A State</em> is an excellent piece of political epistemology, not because he makes a powerful moral argument to curtail the absolute power of the state – which he does – nor because of the trenchant analysis he applies to the material and sociopolitical conditions under which the tools of statecraft are likely to be abused – which he gives – but because it grounds the analysis in a <em>Weltanschauung</em>, an all-encompassing frame of reference, a set of spectacles that underpin the identity of those who wear them. To see like a state is not just to see the world a certain way, to plan with a specific framework, to write with a specific dictionary, but also to <em>be</em> somebody.</p>

<p>Isn’t the same true of startup-land? Isn’t working in a startup with its techno-optimism and its studied disregard of conventional wisdom and Disruption with a Capital D a form of world-view? Weren’t we decades ahead on remote work and Agile / Lean Startup approaches to product development? Don’t startups, especially tech startups, have a distinctive set of incentives and respond to a distinctive set of internal and external cues? Isn’t this weird (physical or virtual) Bay Area we inhabit a conduit for a specific mode of thought, a Weltanschauung, a pair of spectacles?</p>

<p><strong>A full-length biography of Évariste Galois</strong></p>

<p>Évariste Galois died aged 20, after being shot in the stomach with a pistol. He died a gregarious yet unlikable, angry young man, but he bequeathed us a small elliptic body of mathematical work that has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory">proven</a> to be incredibly fertile.</p>

<p>The short biographies that accompany discussions of his work are useful and evocative, but focus almost exclusively on either his precociousness, or the Potemkin-romanticism of his death. His life was short but full of activity, sadness, anger, intense adolescence, mental illness and revolutionary politics.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evariste-Galois-fabrication-ic%C3%B4ne-math%C3%A9matique/dp/2713223172">best biography of him so far (fr)</a> focusses on Galois-as-mathematical-figure (‘personne’ vs ‘personnage’). I’d like to see a full-length biography of Galois-as-boy and Galois-as-man, as well as Galois-as-mathematician: something that draws out the dynamics of a Republican and Bonapartite household in restoration Paris, the stability of his mother and bipolarity of his father (who himself committed suicide when Évariste was 15), the friends and foes, real and imagined, that shaped this troubled young boy.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to write this book for a while, but have <a href="http://jamierumbelow.net/paused.html">put the project on hold</a>. Perhaps I’ll resurrect it one day.</p>

<p><strong>Uses and abuses of popular science</strong></p>

<p>The effective communication of science is incredibly important. What the electorate understands and values about scientific output can translate meaningfully into policy outcomes, on the one hand, and our continued ability to discover more about the world on the other. (At its limit, it can cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Commission_Report">deadly incentives failures</a> when the scientific bureaucracy needs to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher_in_Space_Project">reengage a science-saturated public</a>).  Simplifying without talking down is a tough job, and the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"> very</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00AQLFQKW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">best</a><a href="https://timharford.com/"> writers</a> do it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould">elegance</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter">wit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Sacks">humanity</a>. But so much of it is reductionist, factually incorrect, statistically ignorant, sensationalist drivel.</p>

<p>Writing about science poorly harms us all. Being excessively confident about scientists’ predictions – “toast causes cancer!” – shifts our focus onto the wrong things, or erodes trust in the output of science when it turns out that, you know, the world might be a little more complicated. Being excessively cynical about science’s output is so often a tiresome postmodern ploy to import political solutions to yet-understood social issues.</p>

<p>I’d like to see a book on popular science and the popularisation of science: what good it can do when it’s good, what harm it can do when it’s bad, and how we can get more of the former and less of the latter. I’d also like to learn more about how science fiction fits into all this. We will never get to a stage where science is not weaponised in one direction or another – discovery is, as the physicists of the Manhattan Project discovered, the beginning of the moral story, not the end of it – but with a better understanding of how science is reported, we might be able to give people the tools to at least discount the views of the most egregious of offenders.</p>

<p><strong>What <em>could</em> science look like?</strong></p>

<p>The way that modern science is structured – the categories and classifications of physics, biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, philosophy, the social sciences – forms a reasonably arbitrary and path-dependent structure. A few changes in how humans organised themselves at various stages, how projects got funded, and which questions happened to be salient (for cultural or contingent material reasons), and we have a very different body of knowledge, structured along different lines, today. What, for instance, would modern AI look like if the centre of gravity in computer science hadn’t drifted away from cybernetics and the HCI-focussed research tradition during the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop/dp/1732265119">ARPA golden years</a>, and toward applied mathematics and algorithm design? What could biology look like if our best mathematicians were more interested in biological systems rather than physical systems? What would Newton have done if he hadn’t spent so much time pursuing alchemy?</p>

<p><strong>A good moral, economic and psychological investigation into paternalism.</strong></p>

<p>I have a set of libertarian-ish (which is to say, mostly negative) aesthetic reactions to paternalism, and, in a trivial sense, ‘paternalism is bad’ seems true by definition – at least on a normative reading of ‘paternalism’. Naturally, these intuitions have come into much sharper focus throughout the pandemic. But state interventions in private lives are nothing new, in many cases they are basically uncontroversial (e.g. seat belts) and there are a whole host of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paternalism/">moral</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947001">economic</a> arguments in favour as well as against.</p>

<p>Perhaps paternalistic reasoning is our default mode of thought and respect for individual freedom only gets bolted on in certain contexts? If you really believe that such-and-such a lifestyle is immoral, harmful materially and spiritually to he who practices it, why wouldn’t you want to intervene? Liberalism is a position most have to contort themselves into.
I’d like to see a modern book-length treatment of this subject, exploring the changing relationship between individual and society, ideally within a framework that make sense of big data, the long death of privacy, and crypto- or techno-libertarianism.</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetics in politics.</strong></p>

<p>Hume never got to finish his <a href="https://davidhume.org/texts/t/ad1739">‘examination of morals, politics, and criticism’</a>, but if he had, I imagine much of the project would be spent grounding political discourse in terms of human sentiments like approval and disgust. Jonathan Haidt offers <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0141039167">a modern-day version of this story</a>, arguing for the centrality of psychological states in understanding politics and religious discourse.</p>

<p>But one thing that often gets ignored, I think, is how much <em>aesthetics</em> play a part. People find views they dislike not just disagreeable but <em>ugly</em>, and often detached logical reasoning takes a backseat to matters of taste. I’d wager that a lot of opposition to virtue signalling, for instance, is simply that it seems distasteful, or uncouth, or something like that.</p>

<p>To what extent do we elevate matters of taste to matters of shared social importance? (There’s an interesting Twitter thread <a href="https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1350300376205938688?s=24">here</a> on conservatism and aesthetic sense, which might begin to address these issues.)</p>

<p><strong>The House of Uncommons: the rise and fall of excellence in politics</strong></p>

<p>Why has politics lost its cultural cachet? Why do we pay our governors so little relative to other, <a href="https://dollarsandsense.sg/heres-much-singapores-president-cabinet-ministers-paid-salary/">arguably better run</a>, countries – and certainly less than a lot of private-sector high-status jobs? Are our politicians getting more incompetent and panderous, as they do indeed seem to be? When was the golden era of the politician? What characteristics should we try to select for? Given the unpredictability of democracy and the epistemic credentials of the average voter, how can we reshape our institutions to better encourage the selection of these characteristics?</p>

<p><strong>The Aesthetics of Programming Languages</strong></p>

<p>One thing that often gets lost amongst the computer science jargon and expediencies of writing functional software is that there’s an important <em>aesthetic</em> dimension to programming, a concern with the beauty of the code and algorithms we write. We throw around words like ‘beautiful’ when we talk about code, but we’re usually just gesturing toward some muddy intuitive notion, something like ‘clean’. There’s been little attempt to define these words more rigorously, or explore other aesthetic or aesthetic-adjacent virtues, such as simplicity, or parsimony.</p>

<p>It’s not merely syntactic, either. Much of what a programmer does is invent abstractions, extract out pieces of a system into reusable and more generic chunks. Some abstractions are intuitively better than others. But on what grounds? It’s not just “how widely applicable is this thing”, or “how performant is this thing”, or “how few lines of code does this thing take to implement or call”. There’s a notion of <em>expressivity</em>, the capacity for the abstraction to open and close the right set of logical doors, that is crucially important, and, crucially, misunderstood.</p>

<p>It runs deeper than just the code that actually gets written. Different language design decisions force us to <em>think</em> about our code in different ways, and to structure our programmes along different fault lines. Type systems force us to think about our domain before we think about the processes we apply in that domain. Pure functional languages force us to think about the flow and transformation of data. Different languages, sometimes, though by no means always, designed for different tasks, start with different mental primitives which change both how we write code now, and how the norms of the broader language ecosystem evolve.</p>

<p>The great irony of programming: instructing computers can be a deeply human thing. It would be fun to see a thoughtful little book exploring these questions in more detail.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2020/01/09/kinna-government-of-noone.html">The Government of No One: The Theory and Practice of Anarchism</a></h2>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p><em>Ruth Kinna, Pelican, 2019.</em></p>

<p>Most political ideologies have clear theoretical commitments. Liberalism: the individual as the primitive unit of society; his wellbeing subordinate to, or exhausted by, his freedom; doctrines of rights which circumscribe and define that freedom sitting at the base of any institutional arrangements. Socialism: the collective as the primitive; the individual’s wants subordinate to the group’s needs; a commitment to equality expressed in the common ownership of property.</p>

<p>But anarchism doesn’t really seem to fit. Anarchism, it seems to me, isn’t a political ideology at all: it’s more like a family resemblance, each anarchism approximating the others to a greater or lesser degree, but none admitting of a common core or shared basis. A fluid set of concepts aimed at achieving a form of radical egalitarianism rather than a concrete theory. Or perhaps, like conservatism, it’s more of a temperament, an inclination to gesture toward an outcome, rather than an explicit set of instructions to achieve it.</p>

<p>‘Anti-capitalist egalitarianism’ holds the clue to unlocking it, says Kinna. But ‘anti-capitalist egalitarianism’ is hardly a clearer term than ‘anarchism’.</p>

<p>In one direction, it veers into a Kantian metaphysical liberalism of totally self-regulating agents. In another, it seems to collapse into communism. So the exponent of anarchism as <em>a distinctive tradition</em> must not only explain anarchism on its own terms, but also situate it relative to the primitives of both the liberal and communist traditions, without relying on the primitives of either.</p>

<p>It turns out that such a tradition can be cleaved out from between the two extremes. But it’s awfully difficult to do cleanly.</p>

<p>Kinna does well to reveal anarchism’s parallel world of literature, art and debate. And she does a good job at casting the anarchist in a positive light, of repainting the out of the colours of a psychotic lover-of-chaos and into something a little more.</p>

<p>But it’s not a good book.</p>

<p>One problem is Kinna’s bias, and how it can hinder the book’s analytical power. This is advertised as a “sympathetic account”, and, to that extent, it delivers: she clearly has an affinity with the anarchist programme and is deeply immersed in its literature. But that’s also what makes it a tough book to follow: her familiarity means that she never really explains the basics, leaving the rest of us to reconstruct the edifice on which her explanations sit.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This lack of an accessible introduction means that, to the outsider, it is a book of half-thoughts, non-sequiturs and passages groaning under the weight of technical terminology:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rejection of domination unifies anarchists in shared struggles against the monopolization of resources and the centralization of power, representation, racism, imperialism and authority, while leaving the institutional and sociological mechanisms that explain it open to discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Passages like the above are littered throughout the book, and yet the core concepts they turn on are never really explained. Is domination just shorthand for the ‘monopolization of resources and the centralization of power’? If not, what is it? And if so, why isn’t that compatible with federalism and some liberal anti-trust laws? Isn’t the <em>point</em> of representation to centralise power? And what does it mean to centralise racism and imperalism? Why is authority a bad thing, its centralisation to be struggled against; doesn’t its goodness follow analytically?</p>

<p>And why couldn’t it be that these institutional and sociological mechanisms justify, not just explain the phenomena? Why accept these normative claims in the first place? Answers are not forthcoming, and so the whole thing feels incoherent, and in-groupy.</p>

<p>It is at its most incoherent and in-groupy in the section on education. Education is an important piece of the anarchist puzzle, since most people are in fact decidedly <em>not</em> anarchists, and the political organisation it proposes requires individuals thinking and acting freely in anarchistic (i.e. egalitarian, ‘non-dominating’) ways. But anarchist thought on education, beyond just rehashing Marxist ideas about power sustaining power through ideology, are deeply unenlightening:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowledge is underpinned by linear, instrumental reasoning and this is manipulative and alienating … Education … comes, instead, through re-wilding: reconnecting to undomesticated, genuinely ecological and gentler systems of knowing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so it goes on, and on, and on.</p>

<p>Inaccessibility is this book’s original sin, but it also feels like it’s been rushed to print. Structurally, it’s organised thematically (Traditions, Cultures, Practices, Conditions, Prospects; followed by a set of anarchist biographies, which is mostly filler) and yet it focusses much on the historical development of the ideas, with the result that it keeps jolting, restarting; awkwardly lapsing into chronology, bumping against the ostensible thematic structure. Each insight and thinker tumbles into the next, presenting a cacophony of anarchisms, rather than a single unified theory. All of which means there’s little to no sustained argumentation.</p>

<p>The biggest sin, however, is the lack of a genuine multi-sided discussion of political violence. Government actions are described as “horrifying brutality and evident injustice”; anarchist assassinations and violent direct action are described in much cooler, theoretical terms. Her sympathy means we miss any real discussion of these very important questions: the extent to which political violence is legitimate, necessary or just. And while I understand her reluctance to encourage the typical framing of anarchism as chaos, violence and disorder, violence is anarchism’s shibboleth, and any book on the subject ought to address it.</p>

<p>Instead of a subtle, informed, nuanced debate of both why <em>these given thinkers</em> find it legitimate, and under what conditions <em>we</em> might today, we get quiet acquiescence, defensiveness, deflection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One example of this is the debate about the ‘black bloc’ – the protest tactic associated with politic confrontation. Another is tactical diversity … resonant with the fluidity of historical anarchist activism, [which] encourages activists to ask whether a proposed action is ‘effective at generating power’ rather than ask whether it is ‘peaceful or violent’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s as close as we get to a discussion of this central issue, and it’s a much poorer book because of it.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of content in here. Kinna knows the tradition well. And it may be a valuable reference for somebody already au fait with the anarchist tradition; someone already predisposed to buy what it’s selling. But that’s not me.</p>

    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Some of the main concepts – domination, power, self-emancipation – echo Marx, but seem to be used in a different way; anarchism doesn’t share Marxism’s explanatory basis of historical materialism. Kinna never really explains what anarchists mean by these concepts, perhaps because they’re used so variously that there isn’t any common definition to give. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The London Review of Books has been a good companion to me, its prose crisp and clean and sometimes lyrical, its horizons broad. And while it’s often a little <em>too</em> political, too much on its sleeve – which hinders the analytical power of some of the more polemical pieces – I was a happy subscriber for years and recommend it to anybody.</p>

<p>For the next month, <a href="https://lrb.co.uk">the website’s paywall will be down</a> and everything will be free. I figured I’d use this opportunity to link to a few pieces that I’ve read, enjoyed, not forgotten, or otherwise found interesting.</p>

<p>You could start with <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v20/n23/christopher-hitchens/moderation-or-death">Hitchens on Ignatieff on Berlin</a>, Meany on <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n03/thomas-meaney/the-hagiography-factory">Schlesinger Jr.</a>, or <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v06/n10/bernard-williams/personal-identity">Williams on Parfitt</a>. Two pieces by the philosopher Amia Srinivasan, one <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n17/amia-srinivasan/the-sucker-the-sucker">on octopodes and consciousness</a>, the other <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n06/amia-srinivasan/does-anyone-have-the-right-to-sex">on politics and sexual desire</a> are insightful and elegant. Jeremy Waldron, as ever, writes extraordinarily well <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n17/jeremy-waldron/quibbling-wrangling">on the shape and character of a politics given by a country’s constitution</a>, and the tradeoffs (tradesoff?) involved.</p>

<p>David Runciman is a regular contributor, and always interesting: <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n19/david-runciman/his-fucking-referendum">on David Cameron and the 2016 referendum</a>; <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n12/david-runciman/steely-women-in-a-world-of-wobbly-men">on Theresa May</a>; <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n19/david-runciman/i-didn-t-do-anything-wrong-in-the-first-place">on Trump</a>; <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n15/david-runciman/the-impermanence-of-importance">on Obama</a>; <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n01/david-runciman/what-was-it-that-drove-him">on Gordon Brown</a>; and <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n02/david-runciman/diary">on artificial intelligence</a>. Jonathan Rée wrote <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n24/jonathan-ree/in-such-a-labyrinth">on James Harris’s Hume</a>, and <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n06/jonathan-ree/horrible-heresies">on Edwin Curley’s Spinoza</a>. I’ve enjoyed articles <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n09/adam-shatz/out-of-sight-out-of-mind">on punishment and race in America</a>, <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v38/n15/stephen-sedley/resistance-to-torpor">on Entick v. Carrington</a>, and Geoffrey Hawthorn’s <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n13/geoffrey-hawthorn/what-philosophers-dream-of">reflections on my favourite philosopher, Bernard Williams</a>.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n01/neve-gordon/the-new-anti-semitism">three</a> <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n09/stephen-sedley/defining-anti-semitism">interesting</a> <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v25/n16/judith-butler/no-it-s-not-anti-semitic">pieces</a> on antisemitism, zionism, Israel, its government, and the relations between all of the above; though none, in my opinion, quite understand the relevant problems, or render with enough subtlty the range of opinions amongst diasporic Jews –– and the dangers of getting the answers wrong. (Relatedly, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev8kxj/how-labour-could-start-to-solve-its-anti-semitism-crisis">Ido Vock’s piece in Vice</a> is the best article on this subject that I’ve ever read.)</p>

<p>The LRB occasionally jumps to and revives older texts, like <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n01/michael-wood/don-t-worry-about-the-pronouns">this review of my favourite Iris Murdoch novel, Under The Net</a>. And sometimes <a href="https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v39/n16/patrick-cockburn/endtimes-in-mosul">it doesn’t review texts at all, but instead tells contemporary people’s stories</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the blogs, which always remain free, are also worth exploring. There’s a piece on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2019/january/academic-freedom">Finnis, homosexuality, and academic freedom</a> by Sophie Smith, which helped me see into a blind spot of my liberalism. Or there’s this piece on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2018/september/landmines-in-the-sahara">Landmines in the Sahara</a> by an old acquaintance of mine, Matthew Porges; his piece on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/july/killing-a-camel">Killing a Camel</a> is also good. Srinivasan also wrote <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/january/remembering-derek-parfit">a short obituary on Parfitt, which is charming</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://jamieonsoftware.com/2019/12/14/some-thoughts-on-the-election.html">Some thoughts on the election</a></h2>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Here are a few thoughts, mostly unstructured, and in no particular order, on the general election:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Why is everybody so surprised that so many working-class Northern seats went Tory? The moment Labour prevaricated over their Brexit position was the moment they lost these seats. Delivering Brexit matters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an empirical point I’ve not tested, but <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/05/15/voting-intention-regional-breakdown-apr-24-may-5">it looks like</a> May did the bulk of the work in 2017. Johnson’s – and Cummings’ – brilliance was to leverage it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would only work if they managed to convince the right voters in the right places that Parliament – <em>this</em> Parliament – was the block, and needed replacing. While the rest of us were moaning about prorogation, and mocking Johnson for losing all those votes, he was quietly winning the election – and he hadn’t even called it yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Momentum brigade are just as bad after the election as they were before it. I saw more on my feed from Corbynites trashing the Liberal Democrats than I saw from them criticising the Conservatives. Or even making a positive argument for Labour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relatedly, ‘the media has a right-wing bias’ and ‘FPTP disadvantages us’ are terrible excuses for losing an election. Tough. Of course the media have a right-wing bias. Of course FPTP is a preposterous system that offers the Conservatives an entrenched advantage. We’ve known this for years. The Left needs to learn to work within these constraints rather than decry them. And, this election, Labour <em>singularly</em> failed to do so. This is on you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(By the way, Labour, you had a chance to get rid of FPTP.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ll leave my thoughts on antisemitism in the Labour Party for another day. But they got everything they deserved, and their loss is something to celebrate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Democrats have been bruised, but they’ve been bruised before. And it wasn’t all bad. Increased majorities, a gain in vote share, moving into second place. As my friend E said, if they had held East Dunbartonshire but lost Jamie Stone, they would be saying it was a good night.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it’s likely that ‘presidentialising’ the campaign – “Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats” – killed it more than the revoke Article 50 overreach. As people got to know her more, people liked her less.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, the Conservatives ran a remarkably ugly campaign too, and their victory should be lamented. This was not a victory of ideas. It was the final nail in the coffin that Thatcher and Blair built. Democracy’s epistemic function is over.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being said, I’m a little more optimistic about a Johnson government with a seventy-odd-seat majority rather than a minority, or a 5-seat majority, particularly one enabled by working-class Northern seats. These voters are still, quite rightly, naturally suspicious of the Conservatives. He has very little good will indeed. I think he understands this – his “you’ve lent me your vote” comment is telling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turkeys voting for Christmas? It’s this arrogance and superiority, this smug self-indulgent paternalism (which I’ve indulged in myself) that lost the election for people like me and the ideas I believe in. Of course the average voter doesn’t have the time, skills, knowledge, whatever to make comprehensive, informed decisions. Their vote still counts, and their voice should still be heard. It’s up to politicians to craft a narrative – which is to say, an <em>abstraction</em> of ideas and policy proposals – that resonates with people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it’s easy to forget that most people are instinctively conservative. A lot of people don’t like immigration, or are (reasonably) fearful of its effects. A lot of people don’t like taxes. An increasing number of people have a strongly negative aesthetic response to perceived political correctness, and the social justice movement more broadly. We can debate any of these individual positions until we’re blue in the face, but for a lot of people it’s just a gut thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It now seems clear to me that Remain is no longer an option, democratically or otherwise. We’re not getting a People’s Vote. We are going to leave the European Union, at least formally speaking, in January. In this sense, the debate is over.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another sense, it’s just beginning. Remainers who care about preserving the tangible benefits of EU membership need to plan, regroup, and lean on interest groups, business, the trades unions, local government and the other relevant institutions of civil society to protect or otherwise emulate those benefits in a Brexit context. Democracy doesn’t end between elections (even though it might feel like it does sometimes.) Nor is it only implemented in Westminster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people in my circles – <a href="https://twitter.com/acgrayling">including people who have taught me</a> – are arguing that there’s no mandate for Brexit since the Tories were elected without a majority of the popular vote, or polling suggests slight support for remain, or whatever. This misses the point. We have procedures, whatever issues from those procedures are called democratic, and Brexit, loosely defined, has now issued from those procedures twice. If you don’t like it, change the procedures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might reply with illegal contributions, Russian hacking, lies on busses etc. It’s horrendous, I agree. But I’m starting to think that the fact that enough people <em>believe</em> they voted for Brexit for their own valid reasons, and voted subsequently for the Tories to <em>reaffirm</em> that Brexit position, is enough to make the implementing the outcome both legitimate and indeed required, at least morally speaking (though perhaps not epistemically). You can’t tell people they’re empowered and then not let them wield that power –– certainly not twice. The social contract is a fragile thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m aware of the slippery slope in the point above. I still haven’t figured out what all this means for my theoretical commitments. As with everything in the social sciences – and possibly value theory – it’s a moving target.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was nothing unpatriotic about campaigning for a People’s Vote in the GE. The courts’ suspension of Johnson was not traitorous. People like Dominic Grieve will be looked upon kindly by history. The Remain movement was important, urgent, and its cause noble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we’re having a different conversation now. And I think Remainers need to realise this, lest we beat on, boats against the current. There’s nothing noble in that.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These opinions are, of course, liable to change.</p>
