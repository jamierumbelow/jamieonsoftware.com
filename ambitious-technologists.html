  ‘Move fast and break things’ is still underrated advice. The idea of shipping
  quickly might be memetically abundant within tech, but there are many places
  in the economy where it is not just uncommon, but actively discouraged. There
  are many occasions where companies follow this advice, and
  <a href="https://youtu.be/KA69Oh3_obY?t=1650">win because of it</a>.
</p>
<p>
  But it is easy to let it infect the wrong part of your brain, and
  <em>a fortiori</em> your processes. It’s easy to let it constrain you in
  important, invisible ways. The idea that you should ship quickly forces
  simplicity on everything upstream of the product. You need to do the minimum
  required to get to a shipped product. Nothing more.
</p>
<p>
  This is <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/early.html">considered</a>

    >canonical</a
  >
  <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything"
    >advice</a
  >. But it has some interesting effects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      You might strip out features that could be valuable, but aren’t an
      immediately obvious good – you might go against your hunches / taste in
      favour of what can be justified by data
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You might not add instrumentation, feature flags, and other scaffolding
      that is hugely valuable but becomes difficult to implement in a large,
      existing codebase
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You might not refactor your code properly when it gets messy, shoving it
      further and further down the timeline
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  None of these things are bad per se. But the idea that we should produce the
  absolute minimal thing at every stage – whatever is needed to push the
  company’s commercial goals forward&nbsp;– strongly disincentivises a bunch of
  stuff that takes a product from ‘good enough’ to ‘great’.
</p>
<p>
  And truly great product teams seem to me to
  <a
    href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/02/who-is-excellent-and-why.html"
    >have a vision of excellence</a
  >
  and integrate considerations of the longer-term into the demands of the
  everyday.
</p>
<p>
  Most perniciously, however, the scrappy prototyping approach might produce
  something that is actually a bit shit?
</p>
<p>
  There’s another approach: doing the deliberately difficult thing because it
  creates a technical and product advantage, and most importantly because it
  produces an outcome you’re actually proud of.
</p>
<p>
  In this post, I’d like to give some examples of great companies that have done
  this sort of thing. I’ll call them <em>ambitious technologists</em>, because
  they have a sense of ambition – not just for the company they’re building, but
  for the technology that powers it.

  Early in my time doing web dev, a team of Apple alums launched
  <a href="https://280slides.com/">280 Slides</a>, a browser-based clone of OS
  X’s Keynote. 280 Slides was gorgeous; it was fast, functional, beautiful. If
  you were running it on a Mac, it was easy to forget you were using a web-based
  application at all:

  It’s hardly hideous, and it was obviously enough to build a business and
  threaten the relevant room’s 800-pound gorilla into an acquisition. But this
  was considered decent design and product building, and it still would be:
  remove the bevels, flatten the colours, rewrite it using Tailwind… and it
  wouldn’t look out of place in a YC demo day in 2023.
</p>
<p>
  How did these two teams make products of such an obvious disparity in beauty
  and complexity?
</p>
<p>
  Friendfeed, like most other startups, built a rough-and-ready version of their
  system using common technologies and design patterns.
</p>
<p>
  <em>280 North wrote a new programming language.</em> And rewrote OS X’s Cocoa
  library in it. So they could build the web application they wanted to see,
  rather than the one dragged out of them through rounds of small iterations.
</p>
<p>
  They designed a language called Objective-J, implementing Smalltalk-style
  messaging on top of a JavaScript runtime. They then implemented a UI library
  called <a href="https://www.cappuccino.dev/">Cappuccino</a> in Objective-J,
  creating a suite of tools that could produce what was then an unheard-of
  quality of web application.
</p>
<p>What motivated them to do this?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Incompatibilities between varying JavaScript implementations of browser
      versions
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://evertpot.com/ecmascript-4-the-missing-version/"
        >The failure to standardise ECMAScript 4</a
      >, and the lack of quick innovation in client-side languages
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The lack of proper inheritance, code importing, dynamic dispatch, other
      issues that affected JavaScript the <em>language</em> – and the
      frustration that libraries needed to redesign and reimplement these things
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The difficulty of writing actually richly interactive applications,
      applications that are meant to be competitive with desktop applications
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Cappuccino gave us a web application framework, with a full set of
  standardised and native-like UI controls. They copied the Cocoa APIs precisely
  because that would produce the best quality products:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em
      >Making APIs is hard, so we just said let’s just steal the best API that
      exists… and of course we were Mac programmers and we feel very strongly
      that the Cocoa API is a really really good one; I think it’s hard to deny
      that the stuff on Macs looks pretty darn good, and that’s not despite the
      API it’s because of it</em
    >
  </p>
</blockquote>

  What’s important about this example is that it expressed
  <em>a strong vision for what the web could (and would!) become</em>. They
  rejected contemporaneous approaches, such as Flash, because these approaches
  didn’t meet the quality bar they thought necessary for web applications to be
  legitimate competitors. They wanted web-based technologies that could support
  desktop-style functionality: drag-and-drop, proper graphics rendering,
  undo/redo. They thought the web as a platform could support this, and that if
  web applications were to compete with the desktop, they needed to.
</p>
<p>
  All of this seems obvious now, but back then it <em>really wasn’t</em>. It was
  a bold, ambitious view of what web apps could become. And it took a bold,
  ambitious technological strategy to get there.

<h2><strong>Figma</strong></h2>
<p>
  The early history of Figma is another fascinating example of ambitious
  technologists doing something that wasn’t done, or even particularly sensible,
  on the move-fast-and-break-things model.
</p>
<p>
  Inspired by vector- and canvas-based tooling like
  <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, Figma quickly developed a new
  mode of interaction for design tooling. An important part of that story was
  deciding to build a full graphics editing tool directly in the browser.
</p>
<p>
  To do this, Figma had to implement a large amount of the underlying graphics
  rendering technologies using WebGL:

  When Figma started adding multiplayer support – a key part of their broader
  vision to speed up the feedback loop between design and development –
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/"
    >they took the ambitious approach again</a
  >, reaching back into academic research to implement an entirely realtime
  change management system.
</p>
<p>
  These steps can be justified <em>ex post</em> by thinking about the main
  product goal of the company: to shorten significantly the feedback loop
  between web design and engineering. If the tooling is designed with web-native
  technologies, it can copy and export code directly to those technologies. If
  the tooling is designed with web-native technologies, it can use the
  inherently connected nature of the web to make collaboration and sharing
  easier.
</p>
<p>
  But justifying it <em>ex ante</em>&nbsp;is a tough sell, unless you buy into
  their vision and their ability to solve tough technical problems continuously
  over a long period of time.

    href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-europe-2020-new-feature-announcements/"
    >Indeed, it took them a while to get there</a
  >, but they did it – and the significance of these technical advances are
  obvious.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>The Browser Company</strong></h2>
<p>
  A more recent example of seriously ambitious technologists is
  <a href="https://thebrowser.company/">The Browser Company</a>. They build Arc,
  an attempt to reimagine the web browser. Their attempts so far seem to be
  successful: I was so impressed within the first 20 minutes of using Arc, I
  made it my default. Why? Because it’s so obvious they care about the product.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the best example of them caring about the product quality comes
  somewhat obliquely through their recent announcement that they are
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOMQiMxh5Bc"
    >writing a Swift compiler for Windows</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Browsers are complex, with acute performance needs. Browsers do a tremendous
  amount of processing for every web page, at every layer of the stack:
  networking, UI rendering, CSS layouting, JS runtime, UI rerendering in
  response to user input, page rerendering in response to user input. You can’t
  build a browser with web-based application runtimes like Electron; it’s just
  not fast enough. Low-level performance concerns also exclude C# (<a
    href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/255891/how-does-the-common-language-runtime-improve-performance"
    >the underlying Common Language Runtime is JIT-compiled</a
  >.)
</p>
<p>
  Security is also an unusually important requirement for a browser, especially
  as more of the world’s information processing gets moved to the web. The
  underlying architecture of the browser, and the security posture of the
  technologies that power them, are crucial. Traditionally portable languages
  like C++ make it harder to write secure code.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond performance and security, The Browser Company clearly care about
  introducing beauty and whimsy to their applications: a native application with
  UI that feels aligned with macOS is a huge part of the appeal. Swift is a
  language <em>designed</em> for creating beautiful UIs. Porting this code to
  Windows and rebuilding the experience in Windows-native technologies is a
  non-trivial problem.
</p>
<p>So they decided to run Swift on Windows.</p>
<p>Which, when you think about it, is a little bit crazy.</p>
<p>
  There isn’t a full Swift environment available on Windows (<a
    href="https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-on-windows/"
    >although there have been some attempts</a
  >). In particular, the existing Swift on Windows compiler lacked modern Swift
  language features, proper IDE / language server integration, instrumentation
  and compiler tools, as well as application-level frameworks for rendering UI
  and animations and all the other things that make Arc a delight to use.
</p>
<p>
  They decided to tackle this problem directly, hiring a compiler team and
  porting the underlying language tooling to Windows. By doing the ambitious
  thing, they are taking a short-term hit in terms of technological risk and
  development time, and will give back to the community a suite of tooling to
  write cross-platform Swift application code.
</p>
<p>
  There’s another rationale for this audacious approach: the best way to tank
  your product quality is to make your engineers’ lives miserable. The Browser
  Company have deep expertise with the Swift language and runtime, and a lot of
  existing code. Maintaining two code bases is a pretty significant challenge,
  and it’s important not to discount the benefits of code sharing – especially
  when you want to iterate quickly. They could give their engineering team a
  language and platform that they love, and enable the long-term persistence of
  institutional knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  So far,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa_fNuaSE_I"
    >their attempts seem successful</a
  >. It doesn’t look great just yet:

  But it’s a native Windows application, with native Windows UI, and I’m sure
  that this upfront work will have produced a much better product than the
  alternatives.

<h2><strong>Superhuman and Zed</strong></h2>
<p>
  Two other examples that merit attention are
  <a href="https://superhuman.com">Superhuman</a>, the power-user email client,
  and <a href="https://t.co/LolUML5eT1">Zed</a>, a high-performance code editor.
</p>
<p>
  Superhuman is designed for speed. But did you know they also wrote an entire
  CSS layouting framework in order to get the typography right? From
  <a

    <em
      >The other example, David, that you may have been referring to is actually
      to do a typography and fonts. I'm a big typography nerd. I’ll avoid using
      too much jargon as I go into this example, but I really wanted everything
      to line up with the vertical rhythm on the page. This is really hard to do
      if you're just doing basic web programming. It is in fact impossible—if
      you have different fonts, you have graphical elements, things of different
      sizes—to have everything lined up on an eight pixel or a six pixel grid.
      But we figured out how to do it.</em

  </p>
  <p>
    <em
      >We dove into the Chrome source code, reverse-engineered the font layout
      engine, and then built our own layout framework actually entirely in CSS
      because we wanted this thing to be super fast as well.</em
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    <em
      >Now, whenever we want to lay something out, we have a little tool but in
      just the font, it spits out all the metrics. This is the height of the
      ascender, this is the x-height, this is the cap height, this is the length
      of the descender.</em

  </p>
  <p><em>…</em></p>
  <p>
    <em
      >It generates the CSS to automatically lay this stuff out that it looks
      beautiful. A lot of the reason why the
      <a href="http://superhuman.com">superhuman.com</a> website and the
      Superhuman app looks the way it does is, absolutely everything is on a
      sub-pixel grid to perfection because of the CSS framework.</em

<p>
  On a move-fast-and-break-things model, it makes zero sense to rewrite a CSS
  layouting framework in order to achieve marginal improvements in typography
  rendering and increases in speed. But
  <a href="https://superhuman.com/jobs"
    >two out of three of the Superhuman team’s values</a
  >
  are “Create Delight” and “Remarkable Quality”, and this is a phenomenal
  example of their work living up to those values. Better typography and faster
  rendering improves the email experience in a subtle but significant way. They
  did the right thing, not the easy thing, because they’d make a better product
  by doing so.
</p>
<p>
  Zed have also put an emphasis on speed and responsiveness at the heart of what
  they do. This perhaps makes commercial sense for a text editor, because speed
  is an important dimension of competition. But it would have been a lot more
  common to accept the limitations of the most common underlying platform –
  something like Electron. Instead, the Zed team
  <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/videogame"
    >wrote their own GPU-powered graphics library</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  It takes a certain kind of hubris, and commitment to quality, to build out a
  library of this sort. Especially since <em>existing platforms work fine</em>.
  People build editors with them!
  <a href="https://vscode.dev/">Successful editors</a>, no less. But the Zed
  team wanted to build something better: they were
  <a href="https://twitter.com/zeddotdev/status/1636034633665245184"
    >determined to do better</a
  >. So they did the ambitious thing.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
  <strong>Is being an ambitious technologist actually a good idea?</strong>
</h2>
<p>Probably not!</p>
<p>
  The canonical advice is often good advice. Taking on large technical
  challenges when you are proving the commercial viability of a product is a big
  risk.
</p>
<p>
  But there are many cases where this advice is not good: where it encourages
  incremental thinking; where is cauterises progress. If we are not sufficiently
  bold, we will revert to the mean. And
  <a href="https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average"
    >the mean isn’t where you want to be.</a
  >
</p>
<p>
  Your core competencies very well may be wider than you think. Taking a
  reductionist view on what your company should do might make sense on
  <em>a priori</em> justifications, even if it goes against your instincts and
  taste.
</p>
<p>
  But that’s the problem with taste, hunches, intuition:
  <a
    href="https://iep.utm.edu/int-ext/#:~:text=Chicken%2Dsexers%20are%20individuals%20that,use%20to%20sort%20the%20chickens."
    >it’s often really difficult to explain why you are making the calls that
    you do</a
  >. Even if those calls are the right ones long-term.
</p>
<p>
  The sad fact is that many important technological advancements are built by
  <a href="https://www.generalmagicthemovie.com/"
    >teams that end up losing commercially</a
  >. But that isn’t always the case.
</p>
<p>
  And we can honour these teams’ memories by giving ourselves a higher bar to
  meet. By making something we’re proud of, not just something that gets to
  market quickly, with the minimum amount of work.
